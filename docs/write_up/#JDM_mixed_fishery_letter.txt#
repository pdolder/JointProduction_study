Mixed fisheries capture a mix of species at the same time and are a dominant type of fishery
worldwide. Overexploitation in mixed fisheries occurs when catches continue for available
quota species while low quota species are discarded. As EU fisheries management moves
to count all fish caught against quota (the ‘Landings obligation’), the challenge is to catch
available quota within new constraints, else lose productivity. A mechanism for decoupling
exploitation of species caught together is spatial targeting, but this remains challenging
due to complex fishery and population dynamics in space and time. How far spatial targetting can go to practically separate species is often unknown and anecdotal. Here we
develop a dimension-reduction framework based on joint species distribution modelling
(spatial dynamic factor analysis) to understand how spatial community and fishery dynamics interact to determine species and size composition. In the example application to the
highly mixed fisheries of the Celtic Sea, clear common spatial patterns emerge for three distinct species-groups and, while distribution varies inter-annually, the same species-groups
are consistently found in higher densities together, with more subtle differences within

1

species-groups - where spatial separation may not be practically possible. The results
highlight both opportunities for and limitations of the ability to spatiotemporally separate
catches. We highlight the importance of dimension reduction techniques to focus management discussion on axes of maximal separation in space and time. We propose that
spatiotemporal modelling of available data is a scientific necessity to address the pervasive and nuanced challenges of managing mixed fisheries.

Mixed fisheries and the EU landings obligation Recent Efforts to reduce exploitation rates in
commercial fisheries have begun the process of rebuilding depleted fish populations 1 . Improved
fisheries management has the potential to can increase population sizes and allow increased sustainable catches, yet fisheries catch globally remains stagnant 2 . In light of projected increased

there is an important role for well managed fisheries in supporting fu-

andcoilin there necessitating thatremains a need to ensurecoilin fisheries are

managed efficiently to maximise productivity.

A particular challenge in realising increased catches from rebuilt populations is maximising yields
from mixed fisheries

5–7 .

In mixed fisheries, the predominant type of fishery worldwide, several

fish species are caught together in the same net or fishing operation (known as a ‘technical
interaction’). If managed by individual quotas, and catches do not match available stock quotas, either a vessel must stop fishing when the first quota is reached (the ‘choke’ species) or overexploitation of the weaker species occurs while fishers continue to catch more healthy species and throw
back (‘discard’) the fish for which they have no quota 8 . There is, therefore, a pressing need for
scientific tools which simplify the complexities of mixed fisheries to help avoid discardingmanagers

2

and fishers maximise catchescoilin .

Sustainability of European fisheries has been hampered by this ‘mixed fishery problem’ for decades
with large-scale discarding resulting 9 . A paradigm shift is being introduced Under the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform of 2012 through two significant management changes. First,
by 2019 all fish that are caught are due to be counted against the respective stock quota; second,
by 2020 all fish stocks must be fished so as to be able to produce their Maximum Sustainable Yield
(MSY)10 . The changes are, expected to contribute to attainment of the goal of Good Environmental
Status (GES) under the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD;

11 )

and move

Europe towards an ecosystem based approach to fisheries management 12coilin .

Societal objectives for fisheries to achieve MSY across ecosystem components are paralleled by
Individual fishers goals are tocoilin maximise utility; whether that be profit, income or the continuance of traditional practices. Under the new policy, Unless fishers can avoid catch of unwanted
species they will have to stop fishing when reaching their first restrictive quota. This introduces
a potential significant cost to fishers of under-utilised quota7 and provides a strong incentive to
mitigate such losses

13 .

The ability of fishers to align their catch with available quota depends

on being able to exploit target species while avoiding unwanted catch, Methods by which fishers
can alter their fishing patterns include either by switching fishing method (e.g. trawling to netting),
changing technical gear characteristics (e.g. introducing escapement panels in nets), or the timing
and location of fishing activity

14 .

For example, otter trawl gears are known to have higher catch

rates of roundfish due to the higher headline and wider sweeps which herd demersal fish into the
net while beam trawls employ chain mesh to lift’dig’coilin benthic flatfish species from the seabed15 .

Spatiotemporal management measures (such as time-limited fishery closures) have been applied

3

to reduce unwanted catch with varying degrees of success (e.g.

16, 17 .

However, such measures

have generally been targeted at individual species without considering associations and interactions among several species. Highly mixed fisheries are complex with spatial, technological
and community interactions combining. The design of spatio-temporal management measures
which aim to allow exploitation of high quota stocks while protecting low quota stocks requires
understanding of these interactions at a scale meaningful to managers and fishers. Here, Our
goal is to develop a framework for understanding these complexities. We do so by implementing a
spatio-temporal dimension reduction method and use the results to draw inference on the fisherycommunity dynamics, creating a framework to identify trends common among species-groups. We
use this to describe the potential for and limitations ofwherecoilin spatial measures forcan contribute
tocoilin mitigating unwanted catches in highly mixed fisheries.

Framework for analysing spatio-temporal mixed fisheries interactions We present a framework
for analysing how far spatio-temporal avoidance can contribute towards mitigating imbalances
in quota in mixed fisheries. We use fisheries-independent survey data to characterise the spatiotemporal dynamics of key components of a fish community by employing a geostatistical Vector
Autoregressive Spatiotemporal model (VAST). We implement a factor analysis decomposition to
describe trends in spatiotemporal dynamics of the different species as a function of latent variables

18

representing spatial variation (9 factors; which we call ’average’ spatial variation) and

spatio-temporal variation (9 factors) for encounter probability and positive catch rates (which we
call ’positive density’) separately 19 . We use The resultant factor analysis is used to identify community dynamics and drivers common among 18 species-groups and results presented through
transformation of the loading matrices using PCA rotation. By describing the species-groups dynamics through underlying contributory spatiotemporal factors we can take account of how the

4

factors contribute to affect catches of the species-groups in mixed fisheries. We use Gaussian
Markov Random Fields (GMRFs) to capture spatial and temporal dependence within and among
species groups for both encounter probability and positive density20 . VAST is set in a mixed
modelling framework to allow estimation of Fixed effects to account for systematic differences
driving encounter and catches, such as differences in sampling efficiency (a.k.a. catchability),
while random effects capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of the fish community.

Dynamics of Celtic Sea fisheries We use the highly mixed demersal fisheries of the Celtic Sea
as a case study. The Celtic Sea is a temperate sea where fisheries are spatially and temporally
complex; mixed fisheries are undertaken by several nations using different gear types 21, 22 . Close
to 150 species have been identified in the commercial catches of the Celtic Sea, with approximately 30 species dominating the catch 23 .

We parametrise our spatiotemporal model using catch data from seven fisheries-independent surveys undertaken in the Celtic Sea over the period 1990 - 2015 (Table S1) and include nine of
the main commercial species (see Table S2, Figure 2) : Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Atlantic
haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), Atlantic whiting (Merlangius merlangus), European Hake

(Merluccius merluccius), white-bellied anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius), black-bellied anglerfish (Lophius budegass
megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis), European Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and Common
Sole (Solea solea). These species which make up >60 % of landings by towed fishing gears
for the area (average 2011 - 2015;24 ). Each species was separated into juvenile and adult size
classes based on their legal minimum conservation reference size (Table S2).

We analyse the data to understand how the different associations among emergent species-groups
(combination of species and size class) and their potential drivers affect catch compositions in

5

mixed fisheries. We consider how these have changed over time, and the implications for mixed
fisheries in managing catches of quota species under the EU landing obligation.coilin

Common average spatial patterns driving species associations A spatial dynamic factor analysis decomposes the dominant spatial patterns driving differences in encounter probability and
positive density. The first three factors (after PCA rotation) account for 83.7% of the between
species-group variance in average encounter probability and 69% of the between species-group
variance in average positive density. A clear spatial pattern can been seen both for encounter
probability and positive density, with a positive value associated with the first factor in the inshore
north easterly part of the Celtic Sea into the Bristol Channel and Western English Channel, moving
to a negative value offshore in the south-westerly waters (Figure 1). The species-group loadings
coefficients show plaice, sole and whiting to be positively associated with the first factor for encounter probability while the other species-groups are negatively associated. For average positive
density, positive associations are also found for haddock and juvenile cod. This is indicative of a
more inshore distribution for these species-groups.

On the second spatial factor for encounter probability a north / south split can be seen at approximately 49◦ N while positive density is more driven by a positive value in the deeper westerly waters
as well as some inshore areas. Species-group values for the second factor indicate there are positive associations for juvenile monkfish (L. piscatorius), juvenile hake, juvenile megrim, plaice and
juvenile whiting with average positive density, which may reflect two different spatial distributions
in the more offshore and in the inshore areas (Figure 1).

On the third factor, there is a positive association with the easterly waters for encounter probability
and negative with the westerly waters. This manifests in the species associations as splitsting the

6

roundfish species cod, haddock and whiting which all have a positive association with the third
factor for average encounter probability from the rest of the species-groups which have a negative
association. Positive density is driven by a north / south split (Figure 1), with positive values in the
northerly areas. Juvenile monkfish (L. budgessa and L. piscatorius), cod, juvenile haddock, hake,
adult plaice and whiting are also positively associated with the third factor towards the north while
adult monkfish (L. budgessa and L. piscatorius), adult haddock, megrims, juvenile plaice and sole
are negatively associated reflecting their more southerly distribution (Figure 1).

While this exploratory factor analysis is modelling unobserved drivers of distribution, We considered what might be driving the differences seen in the spatial factor loadings. The first factor was
highly correlated with log(depth) for both encounter probability (-0.85, CI = -0.88 to -0.81; Figure
S1) and positive density (-0.71, CI = -0.77 to -0.65; Figure S2), A random forest classification tree
assigned with 80 % of the variance in the first factor for encounter probability to depth and predominant substrate type, with the majority (86 %) of the variance explained by depth (random forest
classification tree). The variance explained by these variables dropped to 25 % on the second
factor with a more even split between depth and substrate, while explaining 60 % of the variance
on the third factor. For positive density, the variables explained less of the variance with 62 %, 35
%, and 31 % for each of the factors, respectively.

It is clear that depth and to a lesser extent substrate are important predictors for the main driver of
similarities and differences in distributions and abundances for the different species-groups. The
first factor correlates strongly with these variables, despite them not explicitly being incorporated
in the model. While depth was incorporated as a covariate in an alternative model formulation
(see Methods), it was found not to improve predictions. The utility of these variables as predictors
of species distributions has been, as identified in other marine species distribution models 25 ; the
7

advantage to the approach taken here is that, where such data is unavailable at appropriate spatial
resolution, the spatial factor analysis can adequately characterise these influences on species
spatial dynamics.

Changes in spatial patterns over time, but stability in species dynamics While there are clear
spatial patterns in the factor coefficients describing differences in average (over time) encounter
probability and positive density (Figure 1), The inter-annual differences in factor coefficients show
less structure (Figures S5, S6). These inter-annual differences are important as they reflect the
ability of fishers to predict where they can target species from one year to the next, without which
it may be difficult to avoid unwanted catch in close to real-timecoilin . There were, however, While
spatio-temporal factor coefficients did not show consistent trends from year to year across all
species, common patterns in spatiotemporal factor coefficients among species-groups there were
clear relationships (Figure 2). The same factors appear to drive spatiotemporal distributions of
megrim, anglerfish species and hake (the deeper water species, species-grouping negatively associated with the second axes of Figure 2a) and the roundfish and flatfish (species-grouping more
positively associated with the second axes of Figure 2a). For spatio-temporal positive density
(Figure 2b) cod, haddock and whiting (the roundfish species) are separated from plaice, sole (the
flatfish) and deeper water species. As such, From this it can be predicted that higher catches of a
species within a group (e.g. cod in roundfish) would be expected when catching another species
within that group (e.g. whiting in roundfish), . This suggesting that one or more common environmental drivers are influencing the distributions of the species groups, and that driver differentially
affects the species groups, but this could not be explained by temperature is often included as a
covariate in species distribution models, but was found not to contribute to the variance in the first
factor values (Figure S6, no correlations found for either encounter probability or positive density).

8

Three clusters of species show similar spatial patterns ToIn order tocoilin gain greater insight
into the community dynamics we considered how species-groups covary in space and time through
among species-group correlations. Pearson correlation coefficients for the modelled average spatial encounter probability (Figure 3a) show clear strong associations between adult and juvenile
size classes for all species (>0.75 for all species except hake, 0.56). Among species-groups, hierarchical clustering identified the same three common groups as our visual inspection of factor
loadings above, with roundfish (cod, haddock, whiting) closely grouped in their association, with
correlations for adult cod with adult haddock and adult whiting of 0.73 and 0.5 respectively, while
adult haddock with adult whiting was 0.63 (Figure 3a)., flatfish (plaice and sole) are also strongly
correlated with adult plaice and sole having a coefficient of 0.75. The final group are principally
the and species found in the deeper waters (hake, megrim and both anglerfish species) with the
megrim strongly associated with the budegassa anglerfish species (0.88). Negative relationships
were found between plaice, sole and the monkfish species (-0.27, -0.26 for the adult size class
with budegassa adults respectively) and hake (-0.33, -0.37) (Figure 3a) showing strong intragroup correlations indicating spatial separation in distributions. This confirms the associations
among species seen in the factor loadings, with three distinct species-group assemblages being present. This is also evident in correlation coefficients for the average positive density, with
strong associations among the roundfish (Figure 3b) show fewer significant positive or negative
relationships among species-groups then for encounter probability, but still evident are the strong
association among the roundfish with higher catches of cod are associated with higher catches of
haddock (0.58) and whiting (0.47), as well as the two anglerfish species (0.71 for piscatorius and
0.44 for budegassa) and hake (0.73). Similarly, plaice and sole are closely associated (0.31) and
higher catches of one would expect to see higher catches of the other, but also higher catches of
some juvenile size classes of roundfish (whiting and haddock) and anglerfish species. Negative

9

association of juvenile megrim, anglerfish (budegassa) and hake with adult sole (-0.61, -0.61 and
-0.47 respectively), plaice (-0.36 and -0.35 for megrim and hake only) indicate high catches of one
can predict low catches of the other successfully.

In addition to the average spatial correlations, we also estimate spatiotemporal correlations. Spatial
population correlations (representing the average correlations between pairs for species-group x
and species group y across all years) are linearly associated with the spatiotemporal population
correlations (representing how correlations between species-group x and species-group y change
from year to year), indicating generally predictable relationships between species-groups from one
year to the next. This suggests that a positive or negative association between two species-groups
is likely be persist from one year to the next, and that species-groups are consistently associated
with each other in the catch. The correlation coefficients were 0.59 (0.52 - 0.66) and 0.47 (0.38
- 0.55) for encounter probability and positive density respectively. However, a linear regression
between the spatial correlations and the spatio-temporal correlations shows high variance (R2
= 0.36 and 0.22 respectively), indicating that the scale of these relationships does change from
one-year to the next. This would have implications for the predictability of the relationship between
catches of one species-group and another when trying to balance catch with quotas in mixed
fisheries. It can also be seen in the spatial factor maps that there are subtle differences in spatial
patterns in factor loading values from one year to the next (Figures S4 and S5) indicating changes
may be driven by temporally changing environmental factors and species behaviour.

Subtle differences in distributions may be important to separate catches within groups
under the landing obligationcoilin : The analysis shows the interdependence within species-groups
of roundfish, flatfish and deeper water species, where catching one species within the group
indicates a high probability of catching the other species, which has important implications for how
10

spatial avoidance can be used to support implementation of the EU’s landings obligation.

coilin If

production from mixed fisheries is to be maximised, decoupling catches of species between and
within the groups will be key. For example, asking where the maximal separation in the densities of
two coupled species is likely to occur? To address this requirement, we map the difference in spatial distribution within a group for each pair of species within a species-groupings for a single year
(2015; Figure 4). MAYBE PICK HADDOCK AND WHITING AS A QUICK REALLY IMPORTANT
EXAMPLE?coilin

Cod had a more north-westerly distribution than haddock, while cod was more westerly distributed
than whiting roughly delineated by the 7◦ W line (Figure 4a). Whiting appeared particularly
concentrated in an area between 51 and 52 ◦ N and 5 and 7 ◦ W, which can be seen by comparing
the whiting distribution with both cod (Figure 4b) and haddock (Figure 4c). For the deeper water
species (Figures 4d and 4e), hake are more densely distributed in two areas compared to anglerfishes
megrim (though megrim has a stable density across the modelled area as indicated by the large
amount of white space). For anglerfishes and megrim (Figure 4f), anglerfishes have a more
easterly distribution than megrim. For the flatfish species plaice and sole (Figure 4g), plaice appear
to be more densely distributed along the coastal areas of Ireland and Britain, while sole are more
densely distributed in the Southern part of the English Channel along the coast of France.

Predicted catch distribution from a “typical” otter trawl gear and beam trawl fishing at three different
locations highlights the differences fishing gear and location makes on catches (Figure 4h). As
can be seen, both the gear selectivity and area fished play important contributions to the catch
compositions;. In the inshore area (location ‘A’) plaice and sole are the two main species in catch
reflecting their distribution and abundance, though the otter trawl gear catches a greater proportion
of plaice to sole than the beam trawl. The area between Britain and Ireland (location ‘B’) has a
11

greater contribution of whiting, haddock, cod, hake and anglerfishes in the catch with the otter
trawl catching a greater proportion of the roundfish, haddock, whiting and cod while the beam
trawl catches more anglerfishes and megrims. The offshore area has a higher contribution of
megrim, anglerfishes and hake with the otter trawl catching a greater share of hake and the beam
trawl a greater proportion of megrim. Megrim dominates the catch for both gears in location ‘C’,
reflecting its relative abundance in the area.

Addressing the scientific challenges of the landing obligation in mixed fisheries In application
to the Celtic Sea We have identified spatial separation of three distinct species-groupings (roundfish, flatfish and deeper water species) while showing that only subtle differences exist in distributions within species-groups. The differences in catch compositions between gears at the same
location (Figure 4h) show that changing fishing methods can go some way to affecting catch, yet
that differences in catches between locations are likely to be more important. For example, beam
trawls fishing at the inshore locations (e.g. location ‘A’ in Figure 4) are likely to predominately
catch plaice and sole, yet switching to the offshore locations (e.g. location ‘C’) would likely yield
greater catches of megrim and anglerfishes. Such changes in spatial fishing patterns are likely to
play an important role in supporting implementation of the landings obligation.

More challenging is within-group spatial separation due to significant overlap in spatial distributions
for the species, driven by common environmental factors. Subtle changes may yield some benefit
in changing catch composition, yet the outcome is likely to be much more difficult to predict. For
example, Subtle differences in the distribution of cod, haddock and whiting can be seen in Figures
4a-c, showing spatial separation of catches is much more challenging and likely to need to be
supported by other measures such as changes to the selectivity characteristics of gear (e.g.

12

26 ).

A role that science can play in supporting effectiveness of spatiotemporal avoidance could be to
provide probabilistic advice on likely hotspots for species occurrence and high species density
which can inform fishing decisions. Previous modelling studies have shown how spatiotemporal
models could improve predictions of high ratios of bycatch species to target species

27–29 ,

and

geostatistical models are well suited to this as they incorporate spatial dependency while providing
for probabilities to be drawn from posterior distributions of the parameter estimates. We posit
that such advice could be enhanced by integrating data obtained directly from commercial fishing
vessels at a higher temporal resolution, providing real-time forecasts to inform fishing choices that
also captures seasonal differences in distributions, akin to weather forecasting. Advice informed
by a model including a seasonal or real-time component could inform optimal policies for time-area
closures, move-on rules or even as informal information to be utilised by fishers directly without
being reliant on costly continuous data collection on environmental parameters, but by using the
vessels-as-laboratories approach.

An important question for the implementation of the EU’s landing obligation is how far spatial avoidance can go to achieving catch balancing in fisheries. Our model captures differences between
location fished for two gear types and their broad scale effect on catch composition, information
crucial for managers in implementing the landing obligation. It is likely, however, that this analysis
reflects a lower bound on the utility of spatialcoilin avoidance as fine-scale behavioural decisions
such as time-of-day, gear configuration and location choices can also be used to affect catch30, 31 .
Results of empirical studies undertaken elsewhere5, 6 suggest limits to the effectiveness of spatial
avoidance. Differences in ability to change catch composition have also been observed for different fleets; in the North Sea targeting ability was found to differ between otter and beam trawlers
as well as between vessels of different sizes32 .

13

Our framework allows for a quantitative understanding of the broad scale global production set
available to fishers33 and thus the extent to which they can alter catch compositions while operating
in a mixed fishery. Simulations of spatial effort allocation scenarios based on the production
sets derived from the model estimates could be used as inputs to fisher behavioural models to
allow for identification of the lower bounds of optimum spatial harvest strategies. This would
provide managers with information useful for examining trade-offs in quota setting by integrating
potential for spatial targeting in changing catch composition, thus provide a scientific contribution
to meeting the goal of maximising catches in mixed fisheries within single stock quota constraints7 .
Further, the correlations among species could provide information on fisheries at risk of capturing
protected, endangered or threatened species such as elasmobranches, and allow identification of
areas where there are high ratios of protected to target species.

Complex environmental, fishery and community drivers of distribution for groups of species highlights the scale of the challenge in separating catches within the species-groups using spatial
management measures. This has important implications for management of the mixed fisheries
under the EU landings obligation. Our analysis identifies where it may be easier to separate
catches of species (among groups) and where it is more challenging (within groups). We propose
that the framework presented in Figures 1-4 provides a viable route to reducing the complexity
of highly mixed systems. This can allow informed management discussion over more traditional
anecdotal knowledge of single-species distribution in space and time.

Methods

Model structure: VAST1 implements a delta-generalised linear mixed modelling (GLMM) framework that takes account of spatio-temporal correlations among species-groups through implementation of a spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA). Spatial variation is captured through a Gaussian Markov Random Field, while we model random variation among species-groups and years.
Covariates affecting catchability (to account for differences between fishing surveys) and density
(to account for environmental preferences) can be incorporated for predictions of presence and
positive density. The following briefly summarises the key methods implemented in the VAST
framework. For full details of the model the reader is invited directed to Thorson et al 2017 34 .

SDFA: A spatial dynamic factor analysis incorporates advances in joint dynamic species models
34

to take account of associations among species-groups by modelling response variables as

a multivariate process. This is achieved through implementing a factor analysis decomposition
where common latent trends are estimated so that the number of common trends is less than
the number of species-groups modelled. The factor coefficients are then associated through a
function for each factor that returns a positive or negative association of one or more species with
any location. Log-density of any species is then be described as a linear combination of factors
and loadings:

The factor analysis can identify community dynamics and where species have similar spatiotemporal patterns, allowing inference of species distributions and abundance of poorly sampled
species through association with other species and allows for computation of spatio-temporal correlations among species-groups 35 .

Spatio-temporal variation: The spatiotemporal variation is modelled using Gaussian Markov
Random Fields (GMRF) where data is associated to nearby locations through a Matérn covariance
function with the parameters estimated within the model. Here, the correlation decays smoothly
over space the further from the location and includes geometric anisotropy to reflect the fact that
correlations may decline in one direction faster than another (e.g. moving offshore)

20 .

The best

fit estimated an anisotropic covariance where the correlations were stronger in a north-east south-west direction, extending approximately 97 km and 140 km before correlations for encounter
probability and positive density reduced to <10 %, respectively (Figure S9). Incorporating the
spatiotemporal correlations among and within species-groups provides more efficient use of the
data as inference can be made about poorly sampled locations from the covariance structure.

A probability distribution for spatio-temporal variation in both encounter probability and positive
catch rate was specified, ε∗ (s, p, t), with a three-dimensional multivariate normal distribution so
that:
vec[E∗ (t)] ∼ M V N (0, R∗ ⊗ Vε∗ )

(5)

Here, vec[E∗ (t)] is the stacked columns of the matrices describing ε∗(s, p, t) at every location,
species-group and time, R∗ is a correlation matrix for encounter probability or positive catch rates
17

among locations and V∗ a covariance matrix for encounter probability or positive catch rate among
species-groups (modelled within the factor analysis). ⊗ represents the Kronecker product so that
the correlation among any location and species-group can be computed 34 .

Incorporating covariates Survey catchability (the relative efficiency of a gear catching a speciesgroup) was estimated as a fixed effect in the model, δs (v), to account for differences in spatial
fishing patterns and gear characteristics which affect encounter and capture probability of the
sampling gear

36 .

Parameter estimates (Figure S10) showed clear differential effects of surveys

using otter trawl gears (more effective for round fish species) and beam trawl gears (more effective
for flatfish species).

No fixed covariates for habitat quality or other predictors of encounter probability or positive density
were included. While incorporation may improve the spatial predictive performance

34 ,

it was not

found to be the case here based on model selection with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

Parameter estimation Parameter estimation was undertaken through Laplace approximation of
the marginal likelihood for fixed effects while integrating the joint likelihood (which includes the
probability of the random effects) with respect to random effects. This was implemented using
Template Model Builder (TMB;

37 )

with computation through support by the Irish Centre for High

End Computing (ICHEC; https://www.ichec.ie) facility.

Data The model integrates data from seven fisheries independent surveys taking account of correlations among species-group spatio-temporal distributions and abundances to predict spatial
density estimates consistent with the resolution of the data.

18

The model was been fit to nine species separated into adult and juvenile size classes (Table S2)
to seven survey series (Table S1) in the Celtic Sea bound by 48◦ N to 52 ◦ N latitude and 12 ◦ W
to 2◦ W longitude (Figure S8) for the years 1990 - 2015 inclusive.

The following steps were undertaken for data processing: i) data for survey stations and catches
were downloaded from ICES Datras (www.ices.dk/marine-data/data-portals/Pages/
DATRAS.aspx) or obtained directly from the Cefas Fishing Survey System (FSS); ii) data were
checked and any tows with missing or erroneously recorded station information (e.g. tow duration
or distance infeasible) removed; iii) swept area for each of the survey tows was estimated based
on fitting a GAM to gear variables so that Doorspread = s(Depth) + DoorWt + WarpLength +
WarpDiameter + SweepLength and a gear specific correction factor taken from the literature

38 ;

iii) fish lengths were converted to biomass (Kg) through estimating a von bertalanffy length weight
relationship, W t = a · Lb , fit to sampled length and weight of fish obtained in the EVHOE survey
and aggregated within size classes (adult and juvenile).

The final dataset comprised of estimates of catches (including zeros) for each station and speciesgroup and estimated swept area for the tow.

Model setup The spatial domain was setup to include 250 knots representing the Gaussian Random Fields. The model was configured to estimate nine factors each to describe the spatial and
spatiotemporal encounter probability and positive density parameters, with a logit-link for the linear
predictor for encounter probability and log-link for the linear predictor for positive density, with an
assumed gamma distribution.

Three candidate models were identified, i) a base model where the vessel interaction was a ran-

19

dom effect, ii) the base but where the vessel x species effect was estimated as a fixed covariate, iii)
with vessel x species effect estimated, but with the addition of estimating fixed density covariates
for both predominant habitat type at a knot and depth. AIC and BIC model selection favoured the
second model (Table S3). The final model included estimating 130,950 coefficients (1,674 fixed
parameters and 129,276 random effect values).

Model validation Q-Q plots show good fit between the derived estimates and the data for positive
catch rates and between the predicted and observed encounter probability (S11, S12). Further,
model outputs are consistent with stock-level trends abundances over time from international assessments (S13), yet also provide detailed insight into species co-occurrence and the strength of
associations in space and time.
