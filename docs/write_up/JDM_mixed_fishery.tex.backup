\begin{abstract} 
Mixed fisheries have resulted in overexploitation of weaker stocks as
over-quota catches continue in fisheries pursuing available quota of healthy
stocks. As EU fisheries management moves to a system where all fish caught are
counted against the quota (the `Landings obligation'), from 2019 the challenge
will be to catch available quota within the new constraints. Failure to achieve this
will result in lower production as quota for healthier stocks remains
uncaught in order to protect the weaker stocks. Consequently, decoupling
exploitation of species caught together in mixed fisheries has become a
major goal for fisheries sustainability. 
A potential mechanism for decoupling exploitation is spatial targeting, but this remains
challenging due to complex fishery dynamics and a lack of understanding of community dynamics at
fine spatial and temporal scales.  We develop a joint species distribution model to understand how spatial
community and fishery dynamics interact to determine species composition in the highly mixed fisheries of the Celtic Sea. 

Clear common patterns for spatial distribution patterns emerge for three
species groups commonly targeted (roundfish(gadoids??), flatfish and shelf species) and,
while abundance varies inter-annually, the same species groups are commonly
found in higher densities together driven by the same environmental factors (e.g. ??).
More subtle differences in distribution are found within a species group, which
suggest more limited scope to adjust catch to species composition. Here we highlight the importance of dimension reduction techniques to focus management discussion on axes of maximal separation in space and time.\\
Common environmental drivers of distribution for groups of species highlights the
scale of the challenge in separating catches within the species-groups using
spatial management measures, having important implications for management of
the mixed fisheries under the EU landings obligation. [FINAL PARAGRAPH NEEDS WORK. Perhaps something like commented section below?]
%% We propose that spatiotemporal modelling of available data is a scientific requirement to addressing the challenges of the landings obligation. The framework we propose reduces the complexity of the system to it's major components and thus allows informed management discussion over more traditional anecdotal knowledge of single-species distribution in space and time.

\section*{}

\subsection{Mixed fisheries and the EU landings obligation} 

Relatively recent efforts to reduce exploitation rates in industrial fisheries has begun the process of 
rebuilding depleted fish populations \cite{Worm2009}.
Improved management of fisheries has the potential to increase population sizes
and allow increased sustainable catches, yet fisheries catch globally remains stagnant
\cite{FAO2016}. In light of projected increased demand for fish protein
\cite{B??n??2016} there is an important role for well managed fisheries to play
in supporting future food security \cite{Mcclanahan2015} and so there remains a
need to ensure fisheries are managed efficiently to maximise productivity.

A particular challenge in realising increased catches from rebuilt populations
is maximising yields from mixed fisheries \cite{Branch2008, Kuriyama2016,
	Ulrich2016}. In mixed fisheries, the predominant type
of fishery worldwide, several fish species are caught together in the same net
or fishing operation (known as a `technical interaction'). If managed by
individual quotas, and catches do not match available stock quotas, either a
vessel must stop fishing when the first quota is reached (the `choke' species)
or overexploitation of the weaker species occurs while fishers continue to
catch more healthy species and throw back (`discard') the fish for which they
have no quota.

Sustainability of European fisheries has been hampered by this `mixed
fishery problem' for decades with large-scale discarding resulting \cite{Borges2015,
Uhlmann2014}.  However, a paradigm shift is being introduced under the
EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform of 2012 through two significant
management changes.  First, by 2019 all fish that are caught are due to be
counted against the respective stock quota; second, by 2020 all fish stocks
must be fished so as to be able to produce their Maximum Sustainable Yield
(MSY)\cite{EuropeanParliamentandCounciloftheEuropeanUnion2013}. The changes are
expected to contribute to attainment of the goals of Good Environmental Status (GES) under
the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD;
\cite{EuropeanParliament2008}) and move Europe towards an ecosystem based
approach to fisheries management \cite{Garcia2003}. Unless fishers can avoid
catch of unwanted species they will have to stop fishing when reaching their
first restrictive quota. This introduces a potential significant cost to
fishers of under-utilised quota\cite{Hoff2010a, Ulrich2016} and provides a
strong incentive to mitigate such losses \cite{Condie2013, Condie2013a}. \\

The ability of fishers to align their catch with available quota depends on
being able to exploit target species while avoiding unwanted catch. Methods by
which fishers can alter their fishing patterns include by switching fishing
method (e.g. trawling to netting), changing technical gear characteristics
(e.g.  introducing escapement panels in nets), or the timing and location of
fishing activity \cite{Fulton2011b, vanPutten2012a}.

Spatio-temporal management measures (such as time-limited fishery closures)
have been applied to reduce unwanted catch with varying degrees of
success (e.g.  \cite{Needle2011, Holmes2011, Beare2010, Dinmore2003}) while
move-on rules have also been proposed or implemented to influence catch rates
of particular vulnerable species in order to reduce or eliminate discards
(e.g.\cite{Gardner2008, Dunn2011, Dunn2014a}). However, such measures have
generally been targeted at individual species without considering associations
and interactions among several species. Highly mixed fisheries are complex with
spatial, technological and community interactions combining. The design of
spatio-temporal management measures which aim to allow exploitation of healthy
stocks while protecting weaker stocks requires understanding of these
interactions at a meaningful scale to managers and fishers. Here, our goal is to develop a
framework for understanding these complexities. We do so by implementing a
spatio-temporal dimension reduction method and use the results to draw
inference and create a framework to identify trends common among species groups
to describe where spatial measures can contribute to mitigating unwanted
catches in mixed fisheries.

\subsection{Framework for analysing spatio-temporal mixed fisheries
	interactions}

We present a framework for analysing how far spatio-temporal avoidance can go
towards mitigating imbalances in quota in mixed fisheries. We use fisheries
independent survey data to characterise the spatio-temporal dynamics of key
components of a fish community by employing a geostatistical Vector
Autoregressive Spatio-temporal model (VAST). VAST includes i) a factor analysis
decomposition to describe trends in spatio-temporal dynamics of the different
species as a function of \textit{n} latent variables\cite{Thorson2015} to
identify community dynamics and drivers common among species groups. This
allows for inference of the distribution and density of poorly sampled species
through association with the modelled factors. In addition, VAST ii) separately
models spatio-temporal encounter probability and catch rates to allow
identification of differences in associations for distribution of the species
groups and densities upon encounter \cite{Thorson2015a}, it employs iii)
Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs) to capture spatial and temporal
dependence within and among species groups for both encounter probability and
catch rates \cite{Thorson2013}, and iv) is set in a mixed modelling framework
to allow estimation of fixed effects to account for systematic differences
driving encounter and catches, such as survey catch rate differences while
random effects capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of the fish community.

\subsection{Dynamics of Celtic Sea fisheries}

We use the fisheries in the Celtic Sea as a case study. The Celtic Sea is a
temperate sea where a large number of species make up the commercial catches.
Fisheries are spatially and temporally complex with mixed fisheries undertaken
by several nations using different gear types \cite{Ellis2000, Gerritsen2012}.
(MORE SPECIFIC - details of number of species in typical landings, key
species).

We parametrise our spatio-temporal model using catch data from seven fisheries
independent surveys undertaken in the Celtic Sea over the period 1990 - 2015
(Table S1) and include nine of the main commercial species: Atlantic cod
(\textit{Gadus morhua}), Atlantic haddock (\textit{Melanogrammus aeglefinus}),
Atlantic whiting (\textit{Merlangius merlangus}), European Hake
(\textit{Merluccius merluccius}), white-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius
	piscatorius}), black-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius budegassa}),
megrim (\textit{Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis}), European Plaice
(\textit{Pleuronectes platessa}) and Common Sole (\textit{Solea solea}). These
species make up \textgreater 60 \% of landings by towed fishing gears for the
area (average 2011 - 2015, STECF data). Each species was separated into
juvenile and adult size classes based on their legal minimum conservation
reference size (Table S2).

We analyse the data to understand how the different associations among
species-groups (combination of species and size class) and their potential
drivers affect catch compositions in mixed fisheries. We consider how these
have changed over time, and the implications for mixed fisheries in managing
catches of quota species under the EU's landings obligation.

\subsection{Common spatial patterns driving species associations} A spatial
dynamic factor analysis decomposes the dominant spatial patterns driving
differences in encounter probability and abundance. Figure 1 shows the first
three factors for (a) average spatial encounter probability and (b) average
density. The first three factors account of 83.7 \% of the variance in
encounter probability and 69 \% of the variance in density, respectively. A
clear spatial pattern can been seen both for encounter probability and density,
with a positive association with the first factor in the inshore North Easterly
part of the Celtic Sea into the Bristol Channel and Western English Channel,
moving to a negative association offshore in the south-westerly waters. On the
second factor a North / South split can be seen for encounter probability at
approximately the 49$^{\circ}$ N while density is more driven by a positive
association in the deeper westerly waters.  The opposite is evident on the
third factor, with a positive association with the Easterly waters for
encounter probability and negative with the westerly waters, while density is
driven by a North / South split.

The first factor was highly correlated with log(depth) for both encounter
probability (-0.85, CI = -0.88 to -0.81; Figure S1) and density (-0.71, CI =
-0.77 to -0.65; Figure S2). A random forest classification tree assigned 80 \%
of the variance in the first factor for encounter probability to depth and
predominant substrate type, with the majority (86 \%) of the variance explained
by depth. The variance explained by these variables dropped to 25 \% on the
second factor with a more even split between depth and substrate, while
explaining 60 \% of the variance on the third factor.  For density, the
variables explained less of the variance with 62 \%, 35 \%, and 31 \% for each
of the factors, respectively.

It is clear that depth and to a lesser extent substrate are important
predictors for the main driver of similarities and differences in distributions
and abundances for the different species groups. The first factor correlates
strongly with these variables, despite them not explicitly being incorporated
in the model. The utility of these variables as predictors of species
distributions has been identified in other marine species distribution models
\cite{Robinson2011}; the advantage to the approach taken here is that, where
such data is unavailable at appropriate spatial resolution, the spatial factor
analysis can adequately characterise these influences.

\subsection{Changes in spatial patterns over time, but stability in species
	dynamics}

While there are clear patterns in the factor coefficients describing spatial
differences average encounter probability and density, the inter-annual
differences in factor coefficients show less structure (Figures S4, S5).
Temperature is often included as a covariate in species distribution models,
but was found not to contribute to the variance in the factor coefficients
(Figure S6, correlations for either encounter probability or density $\sim$ 0).

While spatio-temporal factor coefficients did not show consistent trends from
year to year, among species groups there were clear relationships. Figure 2a
shows that the same factors appear to drive spatio-temporal distributions of
megrim, anglerfish species and hake (the deeper water species, species grouping
negatively associated with the second axes) on the one hand and the roundfish
and flatfish on the other. For spatio-temporal density (Figure 2b) cod, haddock
and whiting (the roundfish species) are separated from plaice, sole (the
flatfish) and deeper water species. As such, higher catches of a species within
a group would be expected when catching another species within that group. This
suggests that a common environmental driver is influencing the distributions of
the species groups, and that driver is individual to or affects groups
differently.

\subsection{Correlations show three distinct species-group associations}
Pearson correlation coefficients for the modelled average spatial encounter
probability (Figure 3a) show clear strong associations between adult and
juvenile size classes for all species (\textgreater 0.75 for all species except
Hake, 0.56).  Among species groups, hierarchical clustering identified the same
three common groups as above, with roundfish (cod, haddock, whiting) closely
grouped in their association, with correlations for adult cod with adult
haddock and adult whiting of 0.73 and 0.5 respectively, while adult haddock
with adult whiting was 0.63. Flatfish (plaice and sole) are also strongly
correlated with adult plaice and sole having a coefficient of 0.75.  The final
group are principally the species found in the deeper waters (hake, megrim and
both anglerfish species) with the megrim strongly associated with the budegassa
anglerfish species (0.88). Negative relationships were found between plaice and
sole and the monkfish species (-0.27, -0.26 for the adult size class with
budegassa adults respectively) and hake (-0.33, -0.37) indicating spatial
separation in distributions.

Correlation coefficients for the average density (Figure 3b) show less
significant positive or negative relationships among species groups then for
encounter probability, but still evident are the strong association among the
roundfish with higher catches of cod are associated with higher catches of
haddock (0.58) and whiting (0.47), as well as the two anglerfish species (0.71
for piscatorius and 0.44 for budegassa) and hake (0.73). Similarly, plaice and
sole are closely associated (0.31) and higher catches of one would expect to
see higher catches of the other, but also higher catches of some juvenile size
classes of roundfish (whiting and haddock) and anglerfish species. Negative
association of juvenile megrim, anglerfish (budegassa) and hake with adult sole
(-0.61, -0.61 and -0.47 respectively), plaice (-0.36 and -0.35 for megrim and
hake only) indicate generally high catches of one can predict low catches of
the other successfully.

In addition to the average spatial correlations, we also estimate
spatio-temporal correlations.  The spatial correlations (representing the
average correlations across all years) from the population correlations are
linearly associated with the spatio-temporal population correlations
(representing how correlations change from year to year), indicating generally
predictable relationships between species groups from one year to the next,
i.e. a positive or negative association between two species groups is likely be
persist from one year to the next. The correlation coefficients were 0.59 (0.52
- 0.66) and 0.47 (0.38 - 0.55) for encounter probability and density
respectively.  However, a linear regression between the spatial correlations
and the spatio-temporal correlations shows high variance (R\textsuperscript{2}
= 0.36 and 0.22 respectively), indicating that the scale of these relationships
does change from one-year to the next. This would have implications for the
predictability of the relationship between catches of one species group and
another when trying to balance catch with quotas in mixed fisheries. It can
also be seen in the spatial factor scores that there are subtle differences in
spatial patterns in factor coefficients from one year to the next (Figures S5
and S6) indicating changes may be driven by temporally changing environmental
factors.

\subsection{Subtle differences in distributions may be important to separate
	catches within groups under the landing obligation} 
The analysis shows the interdependence within species groups (roundfish,
flatfish and deeper water species) where catching one species within the group
indicates a high probability of catching the other species, which has important
implications for how spatial avoidance can be used to support implementation of
the EU's landings obligation. If mixed fisheries are to maximise productivity,
decoupling catches of species between and within the groups will be key.
Figure 4 shows the difference in spatial distribution within a group for each
of the species groupings for a single year (2015). 

Figure 4a indicates that cod had a more North-westerly distribution than
haddock, while cod was more westerly distribution than whiting roughly
delineated by the 7$^{\circ}$ W line. Whiting appeared particularly
concentrated in an area between 51 and 52 $^{\circ}$ N and 5 and 7 $^{\circ}$
W, which can be seen by comparing the whiting distribution with both cod
(Figure 4b) and haddock (Figure 4c). For the deeper water species Figures 4d
and 4e indicate that hake are more densely distributed in two areas compared to
anglerfishes\footnote{two species combined as they are managed as one} and
megrim (though for megrim, a fairly even relative distribution elsewhere is
indicated by the large amount of white space). For anglerfishes and megrim
(Figure 4f), anglerfishes have a more easterly distribution than megrim. For
the flatfish species plaice and sole (Figure 4g), plaice appear to be more
densely distributed along the coastal areas of Ireland and the UK, while sole
are more densely distributed in the Southern part of the English Channel along
the coast of France.

Figure 4h shows the predicted catch distribution from a "typical" Otter trawl
gear and Beam trawl gear fishing at three different locations. As can be seen,
both the gear selectivity and area fished play important contributions to the
catch compositions; in the inshore area (66) plaice and sole are the two main
species in catch reflecting their distribution and abundance, though the Otter
trawl gear catches a greater proportion of plaice to sole than the Beam trawl.
The area between the UK and Ireland (79) has a greater contribution of whiting,
haddock, cod, hake and anglerfishes in the catch with the Otter trawl catching
a greater proportion of the roundfish, haddock, whiting and cod. The offshore
area has a higher contribution of megrim, anglerfishes and hake with the Otter
trawl catching a greater share of hake and the Beam trawl a greater proportion
of megrim. Megrim dominates the catch for both gears in area 216, reflecting
its relative abundance in the area.

\subsection{Application of framework to support implementation landing
	obligation in mixed fisheries}
Here we describe a framework for analysing mixed fisheries interactions taking
account of technical, spatial and community dynamics. In application to the
Celtic Sea we have identified spatial separation of three distinct species
groupings (roundfish, flatfish and deeper water species) while showing that
only subtle differences in distributions within species groups. The differences
in catch compositions between gears at the same location in Figure 4h show that
changing fishing methods can go some way to affecting catch, yet that
differences in catches between locations are likely to be more important. For
example, beam trawls fishing at the inshore locations (e.g. site 66 in Figure
4) are likely to predominately catch plaice and sole, yet switching to the
offshore locations (e.g. site 216) would likely yield greater catches of megrim
and anglerfishes. Such changes in spatial fishing patterns are likely to play
an important role in supporting implementation of the landings obligation.

More challenging is within groups spatial separation due to significant overlap
in spatial distributions for the species, driven by common environmental
factors. Subtle changes may yield some benefit in changing catch composition,
yet the outcome is likely to be much more difficult to predict. For example,
subtle differences in the distribution of cod, haddock and whiting can be seen
in Figures 4a-c, showing spatial separation of catches is much more challenging
and likely to need to be supported by other measures such as changes to the
selectivity characteristics of gear (e.g. \cite{Santos2016}). 

A role that science can play in supporting effectiveness of spatio-temporal
avoidance could be to provide probabilistic advice on likely hotspots for high
probability of species occurrence and high species density which can inform
fishing decisions. Such advice could be based also on data obtained directly
from commercial fishing vessels at a higher temporal resolution, providing real
time forecasts to inform fishing choices that also captures seasonal
differences in distributions.

An important question for the implementation of the EU's landing obligation is
how far spatial avoidance can go to achieving catch balancing in fisheries.
While this is likely to be fishery specific with differing results observed
elsewhere (e.g. BC, East coast US, - will add refs) here we provide a framework
that could be used to simulate different management and/or fishing effort
scenarios. Such results could inform what additional measures are needed to
support transition to the new management system, in order to ensure mixed
fisheries can sustainably increased catches consistent with rebuilding fish
populations and help support future food security.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection{Model structure:} 

VAST\footnote{software in the R statistical programming language can be found
	here: \url{www.github.com/james-thorson/VAST}} implements a
delta-generalised linear mixed modelling (GLMM) framework that takes account of
spatio-temporal correlations among species-groups through implementation of a
spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA).  In the model, spatio-temporal
variation is represented through three-dimensional Gaussian Random Fields while
covariates affecting catchability (to account for differences between fishing
surveys) and density (to account for environmental preferences) can be
incorporated for predictions of presence and density. The following briefly
summarises the key methods implemented in the VAST framework. For full details
of the model the reader is invited directed to Thorson \textit{et al} 2017
\cite{Thorson2017}.

\textbf{\textit{SDFA:}} A spatial dynamic factor analysis incorporates
advances in joint dynamic species models \cite{Thorson2017} to take account
of associations among species / species-groups by modelling response variables
as a multivariate process. This is achieved through implementing a factor
analysis decomposition where common latent trends are estimated so that the
number of common trends (M) is less than the number of species-groups (N)
modelled ($1 \leq N \leq M$). The factor coefficients are then associated
through a function for each factor that returns a positive or negative
association of one or more species with any location. Log-density of any
species is then be described as a linear combination of factors and loadings:
	\begin{equation}
		\theta_{p}(s,t) = \sum_{j=1}^{n_{j}}
		L_{p,j}\psi_{j}(s,t) +\sum_{k=1}^{n_{k}}
		\gamma_{k,p}\chi_{k}(s,t)
	\end{equation}
Where $\theta_{p}(s,t)$ represents log-density for species $p$ at site $s$ at
time $t$, $\psi_{j}$ is the coefficient for factor $j$, $L_{p,j}$ the loading
matrix representing association of species $p$ with factor $j$ and
$\gamma_{k,p}\chi_{k}(s,t)$ the linear effect of covariates at each site and
time \cite{Thorson2016b}. 

The factor analysis can identify community dynamics and where species have
similar spatio-temporal patterns, allowing inference of species distributions
and abundance of poorly sampled species through association with other species
and allows for computation of spatio-temporal correlations among species-groups
\cite{Thorson2016b}.

\textbf{\textit{Estimation of abundances:}} Spatio-temporal encounter
probability and positive catch rates are modelled separately with
spatio-temporal encounter probability modelled using a logit-link linear
predictor;
		\begin{equation}
			logit[p(s_{i},p_{i},t_{i})] = \gamma_{p}(p_{i},t_{i}) +
			\varepsilon_{p}(s_{i},p_{i},t_{i}) + \delta_{p}(p_{i},
			v_{i})
		\end{equation}

and positive catch rates modelling using a gamma- distribution \cite{Thorson2015a}.  
		\begin{equation}
			gamma[r(s_{i},p_{i},t_{i})] = \gamma_{p}(p_{i},t_{i}) +
			\varepsilon_{p}(s_{i},p_{i},t_{i}) + \delta_{p}(p_{i},
			v_{i})
		\end{equation}

With $\gamma_{*}(p_{i},t_{i})$, $\varepsilon_{*}(s_{i},p_{i},t_{i})$ and
$\delta_{*}(p_{i}, v_{i})$ representing an intercept, spatio-temporal variation
and a vessel effect ($v$) respectively for for either probability of encounter,
$* = p$ or density $* = r$.

\textbf{\textit{Spatio-temporal variation:}} The spatio-temporal variation is
modelled using Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) where data is associated to
nearby locations through a Matérn covariance function with the parameters
estimated within the model. Here, the correlation decays smoothly over
space/time the further from the location and includes geometric anisotropy to
reflect the fact that correlations may decline in one direction faster than
another (e.g. moving offshore) \cite{Thorson2013}.  The best fit estimated an
anisotropic covariance where the correlations were stronger in a North-East -
South-West direction, extending approximately 97 km and 140 km before
correlations for encounter probability and density reduced to \textless 10 \%,
respectively (Figure S10).  Incorporating the spatio-temporal correlations
among and within species provides more efficient use of the data as inference
can be made about poorly sampled locations from the covariance structure.

A probability distribution for spatio-temporal variation in both encounter
probability and positive catch rate was specified, $\varepsilon_{*}(s,p,t)$,
with a three-dimensional multivariate normal distribution so that:
	\begin{equation}
		vec[\mathbf{E}_{*}(t)] \sim MVN(0,\mathbf{R}_{*} \otimes
		\mathbf{V}_{{\varepsilon}{*}})
	\end{equation}

Here, $vec[\mathbf{E}_{*}(t)]$ is the stacked columns of the matrices
describing $\varepsilon{*}(s,p,t)$ at every location, species and time,
$\mathbf{R}_{*}$ is a correlation matrix for encounter probability or positive
catch rates among locations and $\mathbf{V}_{*}$ a correlation matrix for
encounter probability or positive catch rate among species (modelled within the
factor analysis). $\otimes$ represents the Kronecker product so that the
correlation among any location and species can be computed \cite{Thorson2017}.
		
\textbf{\textit{Incorporating covariates}} Survey catchability (the relative
efficiency of a gear catching a species-group) was estimated as a fixed effect
in the model, $\delta_{s}(v)$, to account for differences in spatial fishing
patterns and gear characteristics which affect encounter and capture
probability of the sampling gear \cite{Thorson2014}. Parameter estimates
(Figure S11) showed clear differential effects of surveys using otter trawl
gears (more effective for round fish species) and beam trawl gears (more
effective for flatfish species).

No fixed covariates for habitat quality or other predictors of encounter
probability or density were include. While incorporation may improve the
spatial predictive performance \cite{Thorson2017}, it was not found to be the
case here based on model selection with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

\textbf{\textit{Parameter estimation}} Parameter estimation was undertaken
through Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for fixed effects
while integrating the joint likelihood (which includes the probability of the
random effects) with respect to random effects. This was implemented using
Template Model Builder (TMB; \cite{Kristensen2015}) with computation through
support by the Irish Centre for High End Computing (ICHEC;
\url{https://www.ichec.ie}) facility.  

\subsection{Data}

The model integrates data from seven fisheries independent surveys taking
account of correlations among species-group spatio-temporal distributions and
abundances to predict spatial density estimates consistent with the resolution
of the data. 

The model was been fit to nine species separated into adult and juvenile size
classes (Table S2) to seven survey series (Table S1) in the Celtic Sea bound by
48$^{\circ}$ N to 52 $^{\circ}$ N latitude and 12 $^{\circ}$ W to 2$^{\circ}$ W
longitude (Figure S9) for the years 1990 - 2015 inclusive. 

The following steps were undertaken for data processing: i) data for survey
stations and catches were downloaded from ICES Datras
(\url{www.ices.dk/marine-data/data-portals/Pages/DATRAS.aspx}) or obtained
directly from the Cefas Fishing Survey System (FSS); ii) data were checked and
any tows with missing or erroneously recorded station information (e.g. tow
duration or distance infeasible) removed; iii) swept area for each of the
survey tows was estimated based on fitting a GAM to gear variables so that
Doorspread = s(Depth) + DoorWt + WarpLength + WarpDiameter + SweepLength and a
gear specific correction factor taken from the literature \cite{Piet2009}; iii)
fish lengths were converted to biomass (Kg) through estimating a von
bertalanffy length weight relationship, $Wt = a \cdot L^{b}$, fit to sampled
length and weight of fish obtained in the EVHOE survey and aggregated within
size classes (adult and juvenile). 

The final dataset comprised of estimates of catches (including zeros) for each
station and species-group and estimated swept area for the tow.

\subsection{Model setup}

The spatial domain was setup to include 250 knots representing the Gaussian
Random Fields. The model was configured to estimate nine factors to describe
the spatial and spatio-temporal encounter probability and density parameters,
with a log-link between the logit encounter probability and assumed gamma
distribution on positive catches.

Three candidate models were identified, i) a base model where the vessel
interaction was a random effect, ii) the base but where the vessel x species
effect was estimated as a fixed covariate, iii) with vessel x species effect
estimated, but with the addition of estimating fixed density covariates for
both predominant habitat type at a knot and depth. AIC and BIC model selection
favoured the second model (Table S3). The final model included estimating
130,950 parameters (1,674 fixed and 129,276 random effects).

\subsection{Model validation}

Q-Q plots show good fit between the derived estimates and the data for positive
catch rates and between the predicted and observed encounter probability (S12,
S13).  Further, model outputs are consistent with stock-level trends abundances
over time from international assessments (S14), yet also provide detailed
insight into species co-occurrence and the strength of associations in space
and time.
