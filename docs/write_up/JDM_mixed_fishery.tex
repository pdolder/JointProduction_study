\begin{abstract} 
In mixed fisheries overexploitation of weaker stocks results when catches
continue in fisheries pursuing quota for healthy stocks. As EU fisheries
management moves to a count all fish caught against quota (the `Landings
obligation'), the challenge is to catch available quota within new constraints,
else lose productivity.  

A mechanism for decoupling exploitation of species caught together is spatial
targeting, but this remains challenging due to complex fishery dynamics and
lack of understanding of spatiotemporal community dynamics. We apply a joint
species distribution model to understand how spatial community and fishery
dynamics interact to determine species and size composition in the highly mixed
fisheries of the Celtic Sea. Clear common spatial patterns emerge for three
distinct species-groups and, while distribution varies inter-annually, the same
species-groups are found in higher densities together. More subtle differences
are found within species-groups.

We highlight the importance of dimension reduction techniques to focus
management discussion on axes of maximal separation in space and time. We
propose that spatiotemporal modelling of available data is a scientific
requirement to address the challenges of managing mixed fisheries. \\

\section*{}

\subsection{Mixed fisheries and the EU landings obligation} 

Recent efforts to reduce exploitation rates in commercial fisheries has begun
the process of rebuilding depleted fish populations \cite{Worm2009}.  Improved
management of fisheries has the potential to increase population sizes and
allow increased sustainable catches, yet fisheries catch globally remains
stagnant \cite{FAO2016}. In light of projected increased demand for fish
protein \cite{B??n??2016} there is an important role for well managed fisheries
to play in supporting future food security \cite{Mcclanahan2015} and there
remains a need to ensure fisheries are managed efficiently to maximise
productivity.

A particular challenge in realising increased catches from rebuilt populations
is maximising yields from mixed fisheries \cite{Branch2008, Kuriyama2016,
	Ulrich2016}. In mixed fisheries, the predominant type
of fishery worldwide, several fish species are caught together in the same net
or fishing operation (known as a `technical interaction'). If managed by
individual quotas, and catches do not match available stock quotas, either a
vessel must stop fishing when the first quota is reached (the `choke' species)
or overexploitation of the weaker species occurs while fishers continue to
catch more healthy species and throw back (`discard') the fish for which they
have no quota.

Sustainability of European fisheries has been hampered by this `mixed fishery
problem' for decades with large-scale discarding resulting \cite{Borges2015,
	Uhlmann2014}.  A paradigm shift is being introduced under the EU Common
Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform of 2012 through two significant management
changes.  First, by 2019 all fish that are caught are due to be counted against
the respective stock quota; second, by 2020 all fish stocks must be fished so
as to be able to produce their Maximum Sustainable Yield
(MSY)\cite{EuropeanParliamentandCounciloftheEuropeanUnion2013}. The changes are
expected to contribute to attainment of the goals of Good Environmental Status
(GES) under the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD;
\cite{EuropeanParliament2008}) and move Europe towards an ecosystem based
approach to fisheries management \cite{Garcia2003}. Unless fishers can avoid
catch of unwanted species they will have to stop fishing when reaching their
first restrictive quota. This introduces a potential significant cost to
fishers of under-utilised quota\cite{Hoff2010a, Ulrich2016} and provides a
strong incentive to mitigate such losses \cite{Condie2013, Condie2013a}. \\

The ability of fishers to align their catch with available quota depends on
being able to exploit target species while avoiding unwanted catch. Methods by
which fishers can alter their fishing patterns include by switching fishing
method (e.g. trawling to netting), changing technical gear characteristics
(e.g.  introducing escapement panels in nets), or the timing and location of
fishing activity \cite{Fulton2011b, vanPutten2012a}.

Spatio-temporal management measures (such as time-limited fishery closures)
have been applied to reduce unwanted catch with varying degrees of success
(e.g.  \cite{Needle2011, Holmes2011, Beare2010, Dinmore2003}) while move-on
rules have also been proposed or implemented to influence catch rates of
particular vulnerable species in order to reduce or eliminate discards
(e.g.\cite{Gardner2008, Dunn2011, Dunn2014a}). However, such measures have
generally been targeted at individual species without considering associations
and interactions among several species. Highly mixed fisheries are complex with
spatial, technological and community interactions combining. The design of
spatio-temporal management measures which aim to allow exploitation of healthy
stocks while protecting weaker stocks requires understanding of these
interactions at a meaningful scale to managers and fishers. Here, our goal is
to develop a framework for understanding these complexities. We do so by
implementing a spatio-temporal dimension reduction method and use the results
to draw inference on the fishery-community dynamics, creating a framework to
identify trends common among species-groups. We use this to describe where
spatial measures can contribute to mitigating unwanted catches in mixed
fisheries.

\subsection{Framework for analysing spatio-temporal mixed fisheries
	interactions}

We present a framework for analysing how far spatio-temporal avoidance can
contribute towards mitigating imbalances in quota in mixed fisheries. We use
fisheries-independent survey data to characterise the spatiotemporal dynamics
of key components of a fish community by employing a geostatistical Vector
Autoregressive Spatiotemporal model (VAST). We implement a factor analysis
decomposition to describe trends in spatiotemporal dynamics of the different
species as a function of \textit{n} latent variables \cite{Thorson2015} to
identify community dynamics and drivers common among species-groups. Of
particular importance for mixed fisheries is the ability to analyse
species-groups by underlying contributory factors, which can then be
investigated for what spatio-temporal drivers to which they pertain and how
these jointly affect species-groups. We separately model spatio-temporal
encounter probability and catch rates to allow identification of differences in
associations for distribution of the species-groups and densities upon
encounter \cite{Thorson2015a}, by employing Gaussian Markov Random Fields
(GMRFs) to capture spatial and temporal dependence within and among species
groups for both encounter probability and catch rates \cite{Thorson2013}. VAST
is set in a mixed modelling framework to allow estimation of fixed effects to
account for systematic differences driving encounter and catches, such as
survey catch rate differences, while random effects capture the spatio-temporal
dynamics of the fish community.

\subsection{Dynamics of Celtic Sea fisheries}

We use the highly mixed demersal fisheries of the Celtic Sea as a case study.
The Celtic Sea is a temperate sea where a large number of species make up the
commercial catches.  Fisheries are spatially and temporally complex with mixed
fisheries undertaken by several nations using different gear types
\cite{Ellis2000, Gerritsen2012}. Close to 150 species have been identified in
the commercial catches of the Celtic Sea, with approximately 30 species
dominating the catch \cite{Mateo2016}.

We parametrise our spatiotemporal model using catch data from seven fisheries
independent surveys undertaken in the Celtic Sea over the period 1990 - 2015
(Table S1) and include nine of the main commercial species: Atlantic cod
(\textit{Gadus morhua}), Atlantic haddock (\textit{Melanogrammus aeglefinus}),
Atlantic whiting (\textit{Merlangius merlangus}), European Hake
(\textit{Merluccius merluccius}), white-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius
	piscatorius}), black-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius budegassa}),
megrim (\textit{Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis}), European Plaice
(\textit{Pleuronectes platessa}) and Common Sole (\textit{Solea solea}). These
species make up \textgreater 60 \% of landings by towed fishing gears for the
area (average 2011 - 2015;\cite{STECF2017}). Each species was separated into
juvenile and adult size classes based on their legal minimum conservation
reference size (Table S2).

We analyse the data to understand how the different associations among emergent
species-groups (combination of species and size class) and their potential
drivers affect catch compositions in mixed fisheries. We consider how these
have changed over time, and the implications for mixed fisheries in managing
catches of quota species under the EU landing obligation.

\subsection{Common average spatial patterns driving species associations} A
spatial dynamic factor analysis decomposes the dominant spatial patterns
driving differences in encounter probability and abundance. The first three
factors account for 83.7 \% of the between species-group variance in average
encounter probability and 69 \% of the between species-group variance in
average density, respectively. A clear spatial pattern can been seen both for
encounter probability and density, with a positive coefficient associated with
the first factor in the inshore North Easterly part of the Celtic Sea into the
Bristol Channel and Western English Channel, moving to a negative association
offshore in the south-westerly waters (Figure 1). The species-group loadings
coefficients show plaice, sole and whiting to be positively associated with the
first factor for encounter probability while the other species-groups are
negatively associated. For average density, positive associations are
also found for haddock and juvenile cod. This is indicative of a more inshore
distribution for these species-groups. 

On the second factor a North / South split can be seen for encounter
probability at approximately 49$^{\circ}$ N while density is more driven by a
positive association in the deeper westerly waters as well as some inshore
areas. Species-group associations with the second factor indicate there are
positive associations for juvenile monkfish (piscatorius), juvenile hake,
juvenile megrim, plaice and juvenile whiting for average density, which may
reflect two different spatial distributions in the more offshore and in the
inshore areas (Figure 1).

On the third factor, there is a positive association with the Easterly waters
for encounter probability and negative with the westerly waters. This manifests
in the species associations as splitting the roundfish species cod, haddock and
whiting which all have a positive association with the third factor for average
encounter probability from the rest of the species-groups which have a negative
association (Figure S1). Density is driven by a North / South split (Figure 1),
with the positive coefficients in the Northerly areas. Juvenile monkfish
(budgessa and piscatorius), cod, juvenile haddock, hake, adult plaice and
whiting are also positively associated with the third factor towards the North
while adult monkfish (budegassa and piscatorius), adult haddock, megrims,
juvenile plaice and sole are negatively associated reflecting their more
southerly distribution (Figure 1).

While a factor composition is modelling unobserved drivers of distribution, we
considered what might be driving the differences seen in the spatial factor
loadings. The first factor was highly correlated with log(depth) for both
encounter probability (-0.85, CI = -0.88 to -0.81; Figure S2) and density
(-0.71, CI = -0.77 to -0.65; Figure S4). A random forest classification tree
assigned 80 \% of the variance in the first factor for encounter probability to
depth and predominant substrate type, with the majority (86 \%) of the variance
explained by depth. The variance explained by these variables dropped to 25 \%
on the second factor with a more even split between depth and substrate, while
explaining 60 \% of the variance on the third factor.  For density, the
variables explained less of the variance with 62 \%, 35 \%, and 31 \% for each
of the factors, respectively.

It is clear that depth and to a lesser extent substrate are important
predictors for the main driver of similarities and differences in distributions
and abundances for the different species-groups. The first factor correlates
strongly with these variables, despite them not explicitly being incorporated
in the model. The utility of these variables as predictors of species
distributions has been identified in other marine species distribution models
\cite{Robinson2011}; the advantage to the approach taken here is that, where
such data is unavailable at appropriate spatial resolution, the spatial factor
analysis can adequately characterise these influences.

\subsection{Changes in spatial patterns over time, but stability in species
	dynamics}

While there are clear spatial patterns in the factor coefficients describing
differences in average encounter probability and density (Figure 1), the
inter-annual differences in factor coefficients show less structure (Figures
S5, S6). These inter-annual differences are important as they reflect the
ability of fishers to predict where they can target species from one year to
the next, without which it may be difficult to avoid unwanted catch.

While spatio-temporal factor coefficients did not show consistent trends from
year to year, among species-groups there were clear relationships (Figure 2).
The same factors appear to drive spatio-temporal distributions of megrim,
anglerfish species and hake (the deeper water species, species-grouping
negatively associated with the second axes of Figure 2a) and the roundfish and
flatfish (species-grouping more positively associated with the second axes of
Figure 2a). For spatio-temporal density (Figure 2b) cod, haddock and whiting
(the roundfish species) are separated from plaice, sole (the flatfish) and
deeper water species. As such, it can be predicted that higher catches of a
species within a group would be expected when catching another species within
that group. This suggests that a common environmental driver is influencing the
distributions of the species groups, and that driver differentially affects the
species groups. Temperature is often included as a covariate in species
distribution models, but was found not to contribute to the variance in the
factor coefficients (Figure S7, correlations for either encounter probability
or density $\sim$ 0).

\subsection{Spatial correlations show three distinct species-group
	associations} In order to gain greater insight into the community
dynamics we considered how species-groups covary in space and time through
among species-group correlations. Pearson correlation coefficients for the
modelled average spatial encounter probability (Figure 3a) show clear strong
associations between adult and juvenile size classes for all species
(\textgreater 0.75 for all species except hake, 0.56).  Among species-groups,
hierarchical clustering identified the same three common groups as above, with
roundfish (cod, haddock, whiting) closely grouped in their association, with
correlations for adult cod with adult haddock and adult whiting of 0.73 and 0.5
respectively, while adult haddock with adult whiting was 0.63. Flatfish (plaice
and sole) are also strongly correlated with adult plaice and sole having a
coefficient of 0.75.  The final group are principally the species found in the
deeper waters (hake, megrim and both anglerfish species) with the megrim
strongly associated with the budegassa anglerfish species (0.88). Negative
relationships were found between plaice-sole and the monkfish species (-0.27,
-0.26 for the adult size class with budegassa adults respectively) and hake
(-0.33, -0.37) indicating spatial separation in distributions. This confirms
the associations among species seen in the factor loadings, with three distinct
species-group assemblages being present.

Correlation coefficients for the average density (Figure 3b) show less
significant positive or negative relationships among species-groups then for
encounter probability, but still evident are the strong association among the
roundfish with higher catches of cod are associated with higher catches of
haddock (0.58) and whiting (0.47), as well as the two anglerfish species (0.71
for piscatorius and 0.44 for budegassa) and hake (0.73). Similarly, plaice and
sole are closely associated (0.31) and higher catches of one would expect to
see higher catches of the other, but also higher catches of some juvenile size
classes of roundfish (whiting and haddock) and anglerfish species. Negative
association of juvenile megrim, anglerfish (budegassa) and hake with adult sole
(-0.61, -0.61 and -0.47 respectively), plaice (-0.36 and -0.35 for megrim and
hake only) indicate generally high catches of one can predict low catches of
the other successfully.

In addition to the average spatial correlations, we also estimate
spatio-temporal correlations. Spatial population correlations (representing the
average correlations between pairs for species-group \textit{x} and species
group \textit{y} across all years) are linearly associated with the
spatio-temporal population correlations (representing how correlations between
species-group \textit{x} and species-group \textit{y} change from year to
year), indicating generally predictable relationships between species-groups
from one year to the next. This suggests that a positive or negative
association between two species-groups is likely be persist from one year to
the next, and that species-groups are consistently associated with each other
in the catch. The correlation coefficients were 0.59 (0.52 - 0.66) and 0.47
(0.38 - 0.55) for encounter probability and density respectively.  However, a
linear regression between the spatial correlations and the spatio-temporal
correlations shows high variance (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.36 and 0.22
respectively), indicating that the scale of these relationships does change
from one-year to the next. This would have implications for the predictability
of the relationship between catches of one species-group and another when
trying to balance catch with quotas in mixed fisheries. It can also be seen in
the spatial factor scores that there are subtle differences in spatial patterns
in factor coefficients from one year to the next (Figures S5 and S6) indicating
changes may be driven by temporally changing environmental factors.

\subsection{Subtle differences in distributions may be important to separate
	catches within groups under the landing obligation} The analysis shows
the interdependence within species-groups (roundfish, flatfish and deeper water
species) where catching one species within the group indicates a high
probability of catching the other species, which has important implications for
how spatial avoidance can be used to support implementation of the EU's
landings obligation. If production from mixed fisheries is to be maximised,
decoupling catches of species between and within the groups will be key. For
example, asking where the maximal separation in the densities of two coupled
species is likely to occur? To address this requirement, we map the difference
in spatial distribution within a group for each of the species-groupings for a
single year (2015; Figure 4). 

Figure 4a indicates that cod had a more North-westerly distribution than
haddock, while cod was more westerly distributed than whiting roughly
delineated by the 7$^{\circ}$ W line. Whiting appeared particularly
concentrated in an area between 51 and 52 $^{\circ}$ N and 5 and 7 $^{\circ}$
W, which can be seen by comparing the whiting distribution with both cod
(Figure 4b) and haddock (Figure 4c). For the deeper water species Figures 4d
and 4e indicate that hake are more densely distributed in two areas compared to
anglerfishes\footnote{two species combined as they are managed as one} and
megrim (though for megrim, a fairly even relative distribution elsewhere is
indicated by the large amount of white space). For anglerfishes and megrim
(Figure 4f), anglerfishes have a more easterly distribution than megrim. For
the flatfish species plaice and sole (Figure 4g), plaice appear to be more
densely distributed along the coastal areas of Ireland and Britain, while sole
are more densely distributed in the Southern part of the English Channel along
the coast of France.

Figure 4h shows the predicted catch distribution from a "typical" Otter trawl
gear and Beam trawl gear fishing at three different locations. As can be seen,
both the gear selectivity and area fished play important contributions to the
catch compositions; in the inshore area (location 'A') plaice and sole are the
two main species in catch reflecting their distribution and abundance, though
the otter trawl gear catches a greater proportion of plaice to sole than the
beam trawl.  The area between Britain and Ireland (location 'B') has a greater
contribution of whiting, haddock, cod, hake and anglerfishes in the catch with
the Otter trawl catching a greater proportion of the roundfish, haddock,
whiting and cod while the beam trawl catches more anglerfishes and megrims. The
offshore area has a higher contribution of megrim, anglerfishes and hake with
the Otter trawl catching a greater share of hake and the Beam trawl a greater
proportion of megrim. Megrim dominates the catch for both gears in location
'C', reflecting its relative abundance in the area.

\subsection{Application of framework to support implementation landing
	obligation in mixed fisheries} In application to the Celtic Sea we have
identified spatial separation of three distinct species-groupings (roundfish,
flatfish and deeper water species) while showing that only subtle differences
in distributions within species-groups. The differences in catch compositions
between gears at the same location in Figure 4h show that changing fishing
methods can go some way to affecting catch, yet that differences in catches
between locations are likely to be more important. For example, beam trawls
fishing at the inshore locations (e.g. location 'A' in Figure 4) are likely to
predominately catch plaice and sole, yet switching to the offshore locations
(e.g. location 'C') would likely yield greater catches of megrim and
anglerfishes.  Such changes in spatial fishing patterns are likely to play an
important role in supporting implementation of the landings obligation.

More challenging is within-group spatial separation due to significant overlap
in spatial distributions for the species, driven by common environmental
factors. Subtle changes may yield some benefit in changing catch composition,
yet the outcome is likely to be much more difficult to predict. For example,
subtle differences in the distribution of cod, haddock and whiting can be seen
in Figures 4a-c, showing spatial separation of catches is much more challenging
and likely to need to be supported by other measures such as changes to the
selectivity characteristics of gear (e.g. \cite{Santos2016}). 

A role that science can play in supporting effectiveness of spatio-temporal
avoidance could be to provide probabilistic advice on likely hotspots for high
probability of species occurrence and high species density which can inform
fishing decisions. Such advice could be supported by data obtained directly
from commercial fishing vessels at a higher temporal resolution, providing
real-time forecasts to inform fishing choices that also captures seasonal
differences in distributions. The framework we develop here could be extended
to include commercial data and real-time updates.

An important question for the implementation of the EU's landing obligation is
how far spatial avoidance can go to achieving catch balancing in fisheries.
While this is likely to be fishery and even fisher specific with differing
results observed elsewhere (e.g. in the British Columbia trawl
fishery\cite{Branch2008} and the West US coast\cite{Kuriyama2016}) here we
provide a framework that could be used to simulate different management and/or
fishing effort scenarios. A supporting analysis could be to identify the joint
production function for the entire spatial domain for each pair of species, as
a way of identifying optimum fishing locations to meet a given target or
avoidance objective\cite{Reimer2017}. In conjunction such analysis could
identify the limits of spatial targeting and avoidance in contributing to
meeting the goal of maximising catches in mixed fisheries under single stock
quota constraints. It may also inform what additional measures are needed (e.g.
gear changes, time-area closures) to support transition to the new management
system, in order to ensure mixed fisheries can sustainably increased catches
consistent with rebuilding fish populations and help support future food
security.

Complex environmental, fishery and community drivers of distribution for groups
of species highlights the scale of the challenge in separating catches within
the species-groups using spatial management measures. This has important
implications for management of the mixed fisheries under the EU landings
obligation and our analysis identifies where it may be easier to separate
catches of species (among groups) and where it is more challenging (within
groups). The framework we propose reduces the complexity of the system to it's
major components and thus allows informed management discussion over more
traditional anecdotal knowledge of single-species distribution in space and
time.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection{Model structure:} 

VAST\footnote{software in the R statistical programming language can be found
	here: \url{www.github.com/james-thorson/VAST}} implements a
delta-generalised linear mixed modelling (GLMM) framework that takes account of
spatio-temporal correlations among species-groups through implementation of a
spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA).  In the model, spatio-temporal
variation is represented through three-dimensional Gaussian Random Fields while
covariates affecting catchability (to account for differences between fishing
surveys) and density (to account for environmental preferences) can be
incorporated for predictions of presence and density. The following briefly
summarises the key methods implemented in the VAST framework. For full details
of the model the reader is invited directed to Thorson \textit{et al} 2017
\cite{Thorson2017}.

\textbf{\textit{SDFA:}} A spatial dynamic factor analysis incorporates
advances in joint dynamic species models \cite{Thorson2017} to take account
of associations among species / species-groups by modelling response variables
as a multivariate process. This is achieved through implementing a factor
analysis decomposition where common latent trends are estimated so that the
number of common trends (M) is less than the number of species-groups (N)
modelled ($1 \leq N \leq M$). The factor coefficients are then associated
through a function for each factor that returns a positive or negative
association of one or more species with any location. Log-density of any
species is then be described as a linear combination of factors and loadings:
	\begin{equation}
		\theta_{p}(s,t) = \sum_{j=1}^{n_{j}}
		L_{p,j}\psi_{j}(s,t) +\sum_{k=1}^{n_{k}}
		\gamma_{k,p}\chi_{k}(s,t)
	\end{equation}
Where $\theta_{p}(s,t)$ represents log-density for species $p$ at site $s$ at
time $t$, $\psi_{j}$ is the coefficient for factor $j$, $L_{p,j}$ the loading
matrix representing association of species $p$ with factor $j$ and
$\gamma_{k,p}\chi_{k}(s,t)$ the linear effect of covariates at each site and
time \cite{Thorson2016b}. 

The factor analysis can identify community dynamics and where species have
similar spatio-temporal patterns, allowing inference of species distributions
and abundance of poorly sampled species through association with other species
and allows for computation of spatio-temporal correlations among species-groups
\cite{Thorson2016b}.

\textbf{\textit{Estimation of abundances:}} Spatio-temporal encounter
probability and positive catch rates are modelled separately with
spatio-temporal encounter probability modelled using a logit-link linear
predictor;
		\begin{equation}
			logit[p(s_{i},p_{i},t_{i})] = \gamma_{p}(p_{i},t_{i}) +
			\varepsilon_{p}(s_{i},p_{i},t_{i}) + \delta_{p}(p_{i},
			v_{i})
		\end{equation}

and positive catch rates modelling using a gamma- distribution \cite{Thorson2015a}.  
		\begin{equation}
			gamma[r(s_{i},p_{i},t_{i})] = \gamma_{p}(p_{i},t_{i}) +
			\varepsilon_{p}(s_{i},p_{i},t_{i}) + \delta_{p}(p_{i},
			v_{i})
		\end{equation}

With $\gamma_{*}(p_{i},t_{i})$, $\varepsilon_{*}(s_{i},p_{i},t_{i})$ and
$\delta_{*}(p_{i}, v_{i})$ representing an intercept, spatio-temporal variation
and a vessel effect ($v$) respectively for for either probability of encounter,
$* = p$ or density $* = r$.

\textbf{\textit{Spatio-temporal variation:}} The spatio-temporal variation is
modelled using Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) where data is associated to
nearby locations through a Matérn covariance function with the parameters
estimated within the model. Here, the correlation decays smoothly over
space/time the further from the location and includes geometric anisotropy to
reflect the fact that correlations may decline in one direction faster than
another (e.g. moving offshore) \cite{Thorson2013}.  The best fit estimated an
anisotropic covariance where the correlations were stronger in a North-East -
South-West direction, extending approximately 97 km and 140 km before
correlations for encounter probability and density reduced to \textless 10 \%,
respectively (Figure S10).  Incorporating the spatio-temporal correlations
among and within species provides more efficient use of the data as inference
can be made about poorly sampled locations from the covariance structure.

A probability distribution for spatio-temporal variation in both encounter
probability and positive catch rate was specified, $\varepsilon_{*}(s,p,t)$,
with a three-dimensional multivariate normal distribution so that:
	\begin{equation}
		vec[\mathbf{E}_{*}(t)] \sim MVN(0,\mathbf{R}_{*} \otimes
		\mathbf{V}_{{\varepsilon}{*}})
	\end{equation}

Here, $vec[\mathbf{E}_{*}(t)]$ is the stacked columns of the matrices
describing $\varepsilon{*}(s,p,t)$ at every location, species and time,
$\mathbf{R}_{*}$ is a correlation matrix for encounter probability or positive
catch rates among locations and $\mathbf{V}_{*}$ a correlation matrix for
encounter probability or positive catch rate among species-groups (modelled
within the factor analysis). $\otimes$ represents the Kronecker product so that
the correlation among any location and species can be computed
\cite{Thorson2017}.
		
\textbf{\textit{Incorporating covariates}} Survey catchability (the relative
efficiency of a gear catching a species-group) was estimated as a fixed effect
in the model, $\delta_{s}(v)$, to account for differences in spatial fishing
patterns and gear characteristics which affect encounter and capture
probability of the sampling gear \cite{Thorson2014}. Parameter estimates
(Figure S11) showed clear differential effects of surveys using otter trawl
gears (more effective for round fish species) and beam trawl gears (more
effective for flatfish species).

No fixed covariates for habitat quality or other predictors of encounter
probability or density were include. While incorporation may improve the
spatial predictive performance \cite{Thorson2017}, it was not found to be the
case here based on model selection with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

\textbf{\textit{Parameter estimation}} Parameter estimation was undertaken
through Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for fixed effects
while integrating the joint likelihood (which includes the probability of the
random effects) with respect to random effects. This was implemented using
Template Model Builder (TMB; \cite{Kristensen2015}) with computation through
support by the Irish Centre for High End Computing (ICHEC;
\url{https://www.ichec.ie}) facility.  

\subsection{Data}

The model integrates data from seven fisheries independent surveys taking
account of correlations among species-group spatio-temporal distributions and
abundances to predict spatial density estimates consistent with the resolution
of the data. 

The model was been fit to nine species separated into adult and juvenile size
classes (Table S2) to seven survey series (Table S1) in the Celtic Sea bound by
48$^{\circ}$ N to 52 $^{\circ}$ N latitude and 12 $^{\circ}$ W to 2$^{\circ}$ W
longitude (Figure S9) for the years 1990 - 2015 inclusive. 

The following steps were undertaken for data processing: i) data for survey
stations and catches were downloaded from ICES Datras
(\url{www.ices.dk/marine-data/data-portals/Pages/DATRAS.aspx}) or obtained
directly from the Cefas Fishing Survey System (FSS); ii) data were checked and
any tows with missing or erroneously recorded station information (e.g. tow
duration or distance infeasible) removed; iii) swept area for each of the
survey tows was estimated based on fitting a GAM to gear variables so that
Doorspread = s(Depth) + DoorWt + WarpLength + WarpDiameter + SweepLength and a
gear specific correction factor taken from the literature \cite{Piet2009}; iii)
fish lengths were converted to biomass (Kg) through estimating a von
bertalanffy length weight relationship, $Wt = a \cdot L^{b}$, fit to sampled
length and weight of fish obtained in the EVHOE survey and aggregated within
size classes (adult and juvenile). 

The final dataset comprised of estimates of catches (including zeros) for each
station and species-group and estimated swept area for the tow.

\subsection{Model setup}

The spatial domain was setup to include 250 knots representing the Gaussian
Random Fields. The model was configured to estimate nine factors to describe
the spatial and spatio-temporal encounter probability and density parameters,
with a log-link between the logit encounter probability and assumed gamma
distribution on positive catches.

Three candidate models were identified, i) a base model where the vessel
interaction was a random effect, ii) the base but where the vessel x species
effect was estimated as a fixed covariate, iii) with vessel x species effect
estimated, but with the addition of estimating fixed density covariates for
both predominant habitat type at a knot and depth. AIC and BIC model selection
favoured the second model (Table S3). The final model included estimating
130,950 parameters (1,674 fixed and 129,276 random effects).

\subsection{Model validation}

Q-Q plots show good fit between the derived estimates and the data for positive
catch rates and between the predicted and observed encounter probability (S12,
S13).  Further, model outputs are consistent with stock-level trends abundances
over time from international assessments (S14), yet also provide detailed
insight into species co-occurrence and the strength of associations in space
and time.
