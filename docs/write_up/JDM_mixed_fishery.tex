\begin{abstract} 
Mixed fisheries, where more than one species are caught together in the same
fishing operation, are the predominant type of fishery worldwide. Managed in
the EU through single stock landings quotas, mixed fisheries have resulted in
overexploitation of weaker stock as over quota catches continue in fisheries
pursuing catches of healthy stocks. As EU fisheries management moves to systems
where all fish caught are counted against the quota from 2019 (the 'Landings
obligation') this burden is reversed. The risk instead is that mixed fisheries
will have lower productivity as quota for healthier stocks remains uncaught in
order to protect the weaker stocks unless management can decouple exploitation
their exploitation, an objective fast becoming an important goal for fisheries
sustainability.  A potential mechanism for decoupling exploitation is spatial
management, but this has remained technically challenging due to co-occurrence
of species at fine spatial and temporal scales and a lack of understanding of
how this is driven by community dynamics.  We sought to understanding community
dynamics in the Celtic Sea by applying a joint species distribution model
(VAST) to the nine most important demersal fish species, each separated into
juvenile and adult size classes.  \\

Clear common drivers for spatial distribution patterns emerge for three species
groups (roundfish flatfish and shelf species) and, while abundance varies from
year to year, the same species groups are commonly found in higher densities
together. This indicates common drivers of distribution and the scale of the
challenge in separating catches within the species-groups using spatial
management measures, having important implications for management of the mixed
fisheries under the EU landings obligation.

\section*{}

\subsection{Mixed fisheries and the EU landings obligation} 

Fisheries management has the goal of maximising food production from capture
fisheries (known as 'maximum sustainable yield (MSY)) while protecting all
components of the ecosystem from over-exploitation. In mixed fisheries, the
predominant type of fishery worldwide, several fish species are caught together
in the same net or fishing operation; if managed by individual quotas and
species have divergent conservation goals, overexploitation of the
weaker species can result while fishers continue to catch more healthy species
and throw back ('discard') the species for which they have no quota.

The sustainability of European fisheries have been hampered by this 'mixed
fishery problem' for decades, but a paradigm shift is due to be introduced
under the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform of 2012
\cite{EuropeanParliamentandCounciloftheEuropeanUnion2013}. Two significant
management changes have been made. First, all fish stocks must be fished so as
to be able to produce their MSY by 2020; second, all fish that are caught are
due to be counted against the respective stock quota by 2019. The changes are
expected to contribute to attainment of Good Environmental Status (GES) under
the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD;
\cite{EuropeanParliament2008}) and move towards an Ecosystem based approach to
fisheries management. The changes are particularly challenging for those
operating in mixed fisheries, as unless fishers can avoid catch of unwanted
species they will have to stop fishing when reaching their first restrictive
quota. The potential cost to fishers in terms of under-utilised quota is
significant \cite{Hoff2010a, Ulrich2016} and there is strong incentive to
mitigate such losses \cite{Condie2013, Condie2013a}. The ability of fishers to
align their catch with available quota depends on being able to exploit target
species while avoiding unwanted catch. Methods by which fishers can alter their
fishing patterns include by switching fishing method (e.g. trawling to netting)
and changing technical gear characteristics (e.g. introducing escapement panels
in nets), or the timing and location of fishing activity \cite{Fulton2011b,
	vanPutten2012a}.

Spatio-temporal management measures (such as time-limited fishery closures)
have been applied in the past to reduce unwanted catch with varying degrees of
success (e.g. \cite{Needle2011, Holmes2011, Beare2010, Dinmore2003} while
move-on rules have also been proposed or implemented to influence catch rates
of particular vulnerable species in order to reduce or eliminate discards
\cite{Gardner2008, Dunn2011, Dunn2014a}. However, such measures have generally
been targeted at individual species without considering associations and
interactions among several species. The design of spatio-temporal management
measures which aim to all exploitation of healthy stocks while supporting
weaker stocks requires understanding of the spatio-temporal population dynamics
of fish communities, a prerequisite to improving catch composition through
spatio-temporal management approaches.

\subsection{Incorporating spatial modelling advances into a single framework}

We demonstrate an approach to analysing fisheries independent survey data to
characterise the spatio-temporal dynamics of key components of a fish
community. We employ a geostatistical Vector Autoregressive Spatio-temporal
model (VAST) which includes i) a factor analysis decomposition to describe
trends in spatio-temporal dynamics of the different species as a function of
\textit{n} latent variables. This allows for inference of the distribution and
density of poorly sampled species through association with the modelled factors
and identification of community dynamics and drivers. ii) Spatio-temporal
encounter probability and catch rates are modelled separately to allow separate
characterisation of distributions and densities, iii) Gaussian Markov Random
Fields (GMRFs) are used to capture spatial and temporal correlations within and
among species for both encounter probability and catch rates, iv) this is set
in a mixed modelling framework to allow estimation of fixed effects such as
gear catch rate differences while integrating across random effects.

\subsection{Dynamics of Celtic Sea fisheries}

We use the fisheries in the Celtic Sea as a case study to understand how fish
community dynamics affect the ability of mixed fisheries to change the
composition of their catch through spatial and spatio-temporal avoidance. The
Celtic Sea is a temperate sea where a large number of species make up the
commercial catches (MORE SPECIFIC).

We parameterise our spatio-temporal model using catch data from seven fisheries
independent surveys undertaken over the period 1990 - 2015 [INSERT REF TO TABLE
WITH SURVEYS AS SUPPL] and include nine of the main commercial species:
Atlantic cod (\textit{Gadus morhua}), Atlantic haddock (\textit{Melanogrammus
	aeglefinus}), Atlantic whiting (\textit{Merlangius merlangus}),
European Hake(\textit{Merluccius merluccius}), white-bellied anglerfish
(\textit{Lophius piscatorius}), black-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius
	budegassa}), megrim (\textit{Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis}), European
Plaice (\textit{Pleuronectes platessa}) and Common Sole (\textit{Solea solea}).
Each species was separated into juvenile and adult size classes based on their
legal minimum conservation reference size (INSERT REF TO TABLE WITH SPP SIZES
AS SUPPL).

\subsection{Pearson's correlations show three distinct species associations:}
Pearson correlation coefficients for the average spatial encounter probability
(Figure 1a) show clear strong associations between adult and juvenile
size classes for all species (\textgreater 0.75 for all species except Hake,
0.56).  Among species, hierarchical clustering groups three distinct species
groups; Roundfish (cod, haddock, whiting) are found closely associated with
each other, correlations for adult cod with adult haddock and adult whiting
were 0.73 and 0.5 respectively, while adult haddock with adult whiting was
0.63. Flatfish (plaice and sole) are also strongly correlated with adult plaice
and sole having a coefficient of 0.75. The final group are principally species
found along the shelf edge (hake, megrim and both anglerfish species) with the
megrims more strongly associated with the budegassa anglerfish species (0.88).

Pearson's correlation coefficients for the average density (Figure 1b) show
higher catches of cod are associated with higher catches of haddock (0.58) and
whiting (0.47), as well as the two anglerfish species (0.71 for piscatorius and
0.44 for budegassa) and hake (0.73). Similarly, plaice and sole are closely
associated (0.31) and higher catches of one would expect to see higher catches
of the other, but also higher catches of some juvenile size classes of
roundfish (whiting and haddock) and anglerfish species.

\subsection{Spatial drivers of average species distributions and densities:}
The factor analysis decomposes the dominant spatial patterns driving
differences in encounter probability and abundance. Figure 2 shows
the first three factors for (a) average spatial encounter probability and (b)
average density. These three factors account of 83.4 \% and 69.2 \% of the
variance explained, respectively. A clear spatial pattern can been seen both
for encounter probability and density, with a positive association with the
first factor in the inshore North Easterly part of the Celtic Sea in into the
Bristol Channel and Western English Channel, moving to a negative association
offshore in the south-westerly waters. On the second factor a North / South
split can be seen for encounter probability while density is more driven by a
positive association in the deeper westerly waters. The opposite is evident on
the third factor, with a positive association with the Easterly waters for
encounter probability and negative with the westerly waters, while density is
driven by a North / South split.

\subsection{How species relationships and spatial patterns have changed over
	time:}
Pearson's correlation coefficients for spatio-temporal encounter probability
show weaker but still significant....UPDATE WHEN SEs ARE AVAILABLE

Spatial patterns are less clear for spatio-temporal encounter probability or
spatio-temporal densities, showing subtle changes each year (Figure not shown,
should be in a supplementary?). However, if we plot the first two axes of the
factor loadings for the spatio-temporal encounter probability and densities
(Figure 3) a clear species association pattern emerges.

\section*{Methods}

The model integrates data from seven fisheries independent surveys taking
account of correlations among species-group spatio-temporal distributions and
abundances to predict spatial density estimates consistent with the resolution
of the data. 

[[Model outputs are consistent with stock-level trends abundances over time
from international assessments, yet also provide detailed insight into species
co-occurrence and the strength of associations in space and time.  We use the
outputs to draw inference on the challenges in separating catches of key
commercial demersal fish in moving to the EU landing obligation.]]
