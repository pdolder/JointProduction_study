\begin{abstract} 
Mixed fisheries have resulted in overexploitation of weaker stock as over-quota
catches continue in fisheries pursuing available quota of healthy stocks. As EU
fisheries management moves to a system where all fish caught are counted
against the quota from 2019 (the 'Landings obligation') the challenge will be
to maximise catches within the new constraints. Failing to achieve this will
result in lower productivity as quota for healthier stocks remains uncaught in
order to protect the weaker stocks; therefore decoupling exploitation of
species caught together in mixed fisheries has become an important goal for
fisheries sustainability.  A potential mechanism for decoupling exploitation is
spatial targeting (driven by spatial management or rights-based incentives), but this has remained technically challenging due to
co-occurrence of species at fine spatial and temporal scales and a lack of
understanding of how this is driven by community dynamics.  We sought to
understanding community dynamics in the Celtic Sea, a highly mixed fishery, by
applying a joint species distribution model (VAST) to the nine most important
demersal fish species, each separated into juvenile and adult size classes.  \\

Clear common drivers for spatial distribution patterns emerge for three species
groups (roundfish flatfish and shelf species) and, while abundance varies from
year to year, the same species groups are commonly found in higher densities
together. This indicates common drivers of distribution and the scale of the
challenge in separating catches within the species-groups using spatial
management measures, having important implications for management of the mixed
fisheries under the EU landings obligation.

\section*{}

\subsection{Mixed fisheries and the EU landings obligation} 

Recent decades have seen efforts to reduce exploitation rates in fisheries and
rebuild depleted fish populations start to bear fruit \cite{Worm2009}.
Improved management of fisheries has the potential to increase population sizes
and allow increased catches, yet fisheries catch globally remains stagnant
\cite{FAO2016}.  In light of projected increased demand for fish protein
\cite{B??n??2016} there is an important role for well managed fisheries to play
in supporting future food security \cite{Mcclanahan2015} and so there remains a
need to ensure fisheries are managed efficiently to maximise productivity.

A particular challenge in realising increased catches from rebuilt populations
is maximising yields from mixed fisheries \cite{Branch2008, Kuriyama2016,
	Ulrich2016}. This is because in mixed fisheries, the predominant type
of fishery worldwide, several fish species are caught together in the same net
or fishing operation. If managed by individual quotas and catches do not match
available species quotas for a fishing vessel, either the vessel must stop
fishing when the first quota is reached (known as the 'choke' species) or there
is overexploitation of the weaker species while fishers continue to catch more
healthy species and throw back ('discard') the fish for which they have no
quota.

The sustainability of European fisheries have been hampered by this 'mixed
fishery problem' for decades with large-scale discarding \cite{Borges2015,
	Uhlmann2014}.  However, a paradigm shift is being introduced under the
EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform of 2012 through two significant
management changes \cite{EuropeanParliamentandCounciloftheEuropeanUnion2013}.
First, by 2019 all fish that are caught are due to be counted against the
respective stock quota; second, by 2020 all fish stocks must be fished so as to
be able to produce their Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). The changes are
expected to contribute to attainment of Good Environmental Status (GES) under
the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD;
\cite{EuropeanParliament2008}) and move Europe towards an ecosystem based
approach to fisheries management \cite{Garcia2003}. Unless fishers can avoid
catch of unwanted species they will have to stop fishing when reaching their
first restrictive quota. This introduces a potential significant cost to
fishers of under-utilised quota\cite{Hoff2010a, Ulrich2016} and provides a
strong incentive to mitigate such losses \cite{Condie2013, Condie2013a}. The
ability of fishers to align their catch with available quota depends on being
able to exploit target species while avoiding unwanted catch. Methods by which
fishers can alter their fishing patterns include by switching fishing method
(e.g. trawling to netting), changing technical gear characteristics (e.g.
introducing escapement panels in nets), or the timing and location of fishing
activity \cite{Fulton2011b, vanPutten2012a}.

Spatio-temporal management measures (such as time-limited fishery closures)
have been applied in the past to reduce unwanted catch with varying degrees of
success (e.g. \cite{Needle2011, Holmes2011, Beare2010, Dinmore2003}) while
move-on rules have also been proposed or implemented to influence catch rates
of particular vulnerable species in order to reduce or eliminate discards
(e.g.\cite{Gardner2008, Dunn2011, Dunn2014a}). However, such measures have
generally been targeted at individual species without considering associations
and interactions among several species. Highly mixed fisheries are complex with
spatial, technological and community interactions. The design of
spatio-temporal management measures which aim to allow exploitation of healthy
stocks while protecting weaker stocks requires understanding of these
interactions on a meaningful scale for management measures. Here, we set out a
framework for understanding these complexities. We do this by implementing a
spatio-temporal method for reducing the dimensionality of the problem and use
the framework to identify trends common among species groups to describe where
spatial measures can contribute to mitigating unwanted catches in the Celtic
Sea mixed fisheries.

\subsection{Framework for analysing spatio-temporal mixed fisheries
	interactions}

We present a framework for analysing how far spatio-temporal avoidance can go
towards mitigating imbalances in quota in mixed fisheries. We use fisheries
independent survey data to characterise the spatio-temporal dynamics of key
components of a fish community by employing a geostatistical Vector
Autoregressive Spatio-temporal model (VAST). VAST includes i) a factor analysis
decomposition to describe trends in spatio-temporal dynamics of the different
species as a function of \textit{n} latent variables\cite{Thorson2015}. This
allows for inference of the distribution and density of poorly sampled species
through association with the modelled factors and identification of community
dynamics and drivers common among species groups. In addition, it ii)
separately models spatio-temporal encounter probability and catch rates to
allow identification of differences in associations for distribution of the
species groups and densities upon encounter \cite{Thorson2015a}, employs iii)
Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs) to capture spatial and temporal
correlations within and among species groups for both encounter probability and
catch rates \cite{Thorson2013}, and iv) the approach is set in a mixed
modelling framework to allow estimation of fixed effects to account for
systematic differences driving encounter and catches, such as survey catch rate
differences, while integrating across random effects which capture the
spatio-temporal properties of the fish community.

\subsection{Dynamics of Celtic Sea fisheries}

We use the fisheries in the Celtic Sea as a case study. The Celtic Sea is a
temperate sea where a large number of species make up the commercial catches.
Fisheries are spatially and temporally complex with mixed fisheries undertaken
by several nations using different gear types \cite{Ellis2000, Gerritsen2012}.
(MORE SPECIFIC - details of number of species in typical landings, key
species).

We parametrise our spatio-temporal model using catch data from seven fisheries
independent surveys undertaken over the period 1990 - 2015 (Table S1) and
include nine of the main commercial species: Atlantic cod (\textit{Gadus
	morhua}), Atlantic haddock (\textit{Melanogrammus aeglefinus}),
Atlantic whiting (\textit{Merlangius merlangus}), European Hake
(\textit{Merluccius merluccius}), white-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius
	piscatorius}), black-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius budegassa}),
megrim (\textit{Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis}), European Plaice
(\textit{Pleuronectes platessa}) and Common Sole (\textit{Solea solea}). These
species make up \textgreater 60 \% of landings by towed fishing gears for the
area (average 2011 - 2015, STECF data). Each species was separated into
juvenile and adult size classes based on their legal minimum conservation
reference size (Table S2).

We analyse the data to understand how the different associations among
species-groups (combination of species and size class) and their potential
drivers. We consider how these have changed over time, and the implications for
mixed fisheries in managing catches of quota species under the EU's landings
obligation.

\subsection{Common spatial patterns driving species associations}
A spatial dynamic factor analysis decomposes the dominant spatial patterns
driving differences in encounter probability and abundance. Figure 1 shows the
first three factors for (a) average spatial encounter probability and (b)
average density. The first three factors account of 83.4 \% of the variance in
encounter probability and 69.2 \% of the variance in density, respectively. A
clear spatial pattern can been seen both for encounter probability and density,
with a positive association with the first factor in the inshore North Easterly
part of the Celtic Sea into the Bristol Channel and Western English Channel,
moving to a negative association offshore in the south-westerly waters. On the
second factor a North / South split can be seen for encounter probability at
approximately the 49$^{\circ}$ N while density is more driven by a positive
association in the deeper westerly waters.  The opposite is evident on the
third factor, with a positive association with the Easterly waters for
encounter probability and negative with the westerly waters, while density is
driven by a North / South split.

The first factor [NOTE:  I edited this, and use the term "loading" to mean the coefficient multiplied by the factor when predicting density for a single species] was highly correlated with
log(depth) for both encounter probability (-0.85, CI = -0.88 to -0.81; Figure
S1) and density (-0.71, CI = -0.77 to -0.65; Figure S2). A random forest
classification tree assigned 80 \% of the variance in the first factor for
encounter probability to depth and predominant habitat type, with the majority
(86 \%) of the variance explained by depth. The contribution of these
covariates dropped to 25 \% on the second factor with a more even split between
depth and habitat, while explaining 60 \% of the variance on the third factor.
For density, the covariates explained less of the variance with 62 \%, 35 \%,
and 31 \% for each of the factors, respectively.

It is clear that depth and to a lesser extent habitat are important predictors
for the main driver of similarities and differences in distributions and
abundances for the different species groups. The first factor correlates
strongly with these variables, despite them not explicitly being incorporated
in the model. The utility of these variables as predictors of species
distributions has been identified in other marine species distribution models
\cite{Robinson2011}; the advantage to the approach taken here is that, where such
data is unavailable at appropriate spatial resolution, the spatial factor
analysis can adequately characterise these influences.

\subsection{Changes in spatial patterns over time, but stability in species
	dynamics}

While there are clear spatial patterns in the factors describing average
encounter probability and density, there are inter-annual differences in factor
loadings which show less structure (Figures S4, S5). While temperature is often
included as a covariate in species distribution models it was found not to
contribute to the variance in the factor loadings (Figure S6, correlations for
both encounter probability and density $\sim$ 0).

While spatio-temporal factor loadings did not show common trends, among species
groups there were common dynamics. Figure 2a shows that the same factors appear
to drive spatio-temporal distributions of megrim, anglerfish species and hake
(the deeper water species, species grouping negatively loaded on the second
axes) on the one hand and the roundfish and flatfish on the other. For
spatio-temporal density (Figure 2b) cod, haddock and whiting (the roundfish
species) are separated from plaice, sole (the flatfish) and deeper water
species. As such, higher catches the other roundfish species group would be
expected when catching one species group. This suggests that a common
environmental driver is influencing the distributions of the species groups.

\subsection{Correlations show three distinct species-group associations}
Pearson correlation coefficients for the modelled average spatial encounter
probability (Figure 3a) show clear strong associations between adult and
juvenile size classes for all species (\textgreater 0.75 for all species except
Hake, 0.56).  Among species groups, hierarchical clustering identified three
common groups; Roundfish (cod, haddock, whiting) are found closely associated,
with correlations for adult cod with adult haddock and adult whiting of 0.73
and 0.5 respectively, while adult haddock with adult whiting was 0.63. Flatfish
(plaice and sole) are also strongly correlated with adult plaice and sole
having a coefficient of 0.75.  The final group are principally species found in
the deeper waters (hake, megrim and both anglerfish species) with the megrim
strongly associated with the budegassa anglerfish species (0.88). Negative
relationships were found between plaice and sole and the monkfish species
(-0.27, -0.26 for the adult size class with budegassa adults respectively) and
hake (-0.33, -0.37) indicating spatial separation in distributions.

Correlation coefficients for the average density (Figure 3b) show less
significant relationships then for encounter probability, but still evident are
the strong association among the roundfish with higher catches of cod are
associated with higher catches of haddock (0.58) and whiting (0.47), as well as
the two anglerfish species (0.71 for piscatorius and 0.44 for budegassa) and
hake (0.73). Similarly, plaice and sole are closely associated (0.31) and
higher catches of one would expect to see higher catches of the other, but also
higher catches of some juvenile size classes of roundfish (whiting and haddock)
and anglerfish species. Negative association of juvenile megrim, anglerfish
(budegassa) and hake with adult sole (-0.61, -0.61 and -0.47 respectively),
plaice (-0.36 and -0.35 for megrim and hake only) indicate generally high
abundance of one can predict low abundance of the other successfully.

[[Pearson's correlation coefficients for spatio-temporal encounter probability
and density show similar though weaker correlations to the average values
described above (Figures S7).  The average values are correlated with the
spatio-temporal values indicating generally similar relationships (0.59 (0.52 -
0.66) and 0.47 (0.38 - 0.55) for encounter probability and density
respectively) though a linear regression shows high variance
(R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.36 and 0.22 respectively) indicating that the
inter-year variations in the inter-species group correlations drive some
differences in species compositions from one-year to the next.  This can be
seen in the spatial factor loadings which show subtle differences in spatial
patterns from one year to the next (Figures S5 and S6).]]

\subsection{Implications for species avoidance in mixed fisheries under the
	landings obligation} 
The analysis shows the interdependence within species groups (roundfish,
flatfish and deeper water species) which has important implications for how
spatial avoidance can be used to support implementation of the EU's landings
obligation. If mixed fisheries are to maximise productivity, decoupling catches
of species between and among the groups will be key.  Methods to do this
include changes to the selectivity characteristics of gear (e.g.
\cite{Santos2016}) and spatio-temporal avoidance. Both are likely to play a
role but the extent to which they can contribute to fisheries sustainability is
unknown. While here we demonstrate the separation of three distinct species
groupings (roundfish, flatfish and deeper water species) separating catches
within groups is likely to be equally as important.  Figure 4 shows the
difference in spatial distribution within a group for each of the species
groupings for a single year (2015). 

Figure 4a indicates that cod had a more North-westerly distribution than
haddock while cod had more westerly distribution than whiting roughly
delineated by the 7$^{\circ}$ W line. Whiting appeared particularly
concentrated in an area between 51 and 52 $^{\circ}$ N and 5 and 7 $^{\circ}$
W, which can be seen by comparing the whiting distribution with both cod
(Figure 4b) and haddock (Figure 4c). For the deeper water species Figures 4d and 4e
indicate that hake are particularly concentrated in two areas compared to
anglerfishes\footnote{two species combined as they are managed as one} and
megrim (though for megrim, a fairly even relative distribution elsewhere is
indicated by the large amount of white space). For anglerfishes and megrim
(Figure 4f), anglerfishes have a more easterly distribution than megrim. For
the flatfish species plaice and sole (Figure 4g), sole appear to be more
concentrated along the coastal areas of Ireland and the UK, while Plaice are
more concentrated in the Southern part of the English Channel along the coast
of France.

These nuanced differences in distribution can have important implications for
fishers seeking to fish in areas which match their quota holdings. Figure 4h
shows the predicted catch distribution from a "typical" Otter trawl gear and
Beam trawl gear fishing at three different locations. As can be seen, both the
gear selectivity and area fished play important contributions to the catch
compositions; in the inshore area (66) plaice and sole are the two main species
in catch reflecting their distribution and abundance, though the Otter trawl
gear catches a greater proportion of plaice than the Beam trawl. The area
between the UK and Ireland (79) has a greater contribution of whiting, haddock,
cod, hake and anglerfishes in the catch with the Otter trawl catching a greater
proportion of the roundfish, haddock, whiting and cod. The offshore area has a
higher contribution of megrim, anglerfishes and hake with the Otter trawl
catching a greater share of hake and the Beam trawl a greater proportion of
megrim. Megrim dominates the catch for both gears in area 216, reflecting its
relative abundance in the area.

Figure 5 shows the joint production function for the entire spatial domain,
giving the global production sets for the years 2011 - 2015. It gives the space
in which vessels have to operate where they can change the relative composition
of each species in the catch as a function of changing location fished only.
The convex hull of the space is the flexibility vessels have in order to adapt
to the changing fishing opportunities given the association of species with
each other\cite{Reimer2017}. As can be seen from Figure 5a which shows the
trade-off between cod and haddock for an Otter trawler....

Figure 5b shows the same for plaice and sole for a Beam trawler...

\section*{Methods}



The model integrates data from seven fisheries independent surveys taking
account of correlations among species-group spatio-temporal distributions and
abundances to predict spatial density estimates consistent with the resolution
of the data. 

[[Model outputs are consistent with stock-level trends abundances over time
from international assessments, yet also provide detailed insight into species
co-occurrence and the strength of associations in space and time.  We use the
outputs to draw inference on the challenges in separating catches of key
commercial demersal fish in moving to the EU landing obligation.]]
