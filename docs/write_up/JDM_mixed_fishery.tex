\begin{abstract} 
Mixed fisheries, where more than one species are caught together in the same
fishing operation, are the predominant type of fishery worldwide. Managed in
the EU through single stock landings quotas, mixed fisheries have resulted in
overexploitation of weaker stock as over quota catches continue in fisheries
pursuing catches of healthy stocks. As EU fisheries management moves to systems
where all fish caught are counted against the quota from 2019 (the 'Landings
obligation') this burden is reversed. The risk instead is that mixed fisheries
will have lower productivity as quota for healthier stocks remains uncaught in
order to protect the weaker stocks unless management can decouple exploitation
their exploitation, an important goal for fisheries sustainability.  A
potential mechanism for decoupling exploitation is spatial management, but this
has remained technically challenging due to co-occurrence of species at fine
spatial and temporal scales and a lack of understanding of how this is driven
by community dynamics.  We sought to understanding community dynamics in the
Celtic Sea by applying a joint species distribution model (VAST) to the nine
most important demersal fish species, each separated into juvenile and adult
size classes.  \\

Clear common drivers for spatial distribution patterns emerge for three species
groups (roundfish flatfish and shelf species) and, while abundance varies from
year to year, the same species groups are commonly found in higher densities
together. This indicates common drivers of distribution and the scale of the
challenge in separating catches within the species-groups using spatial
management measures, having important implications for management of the mixed
fisheries under the EU landings obligation.

\section*{}

\subsection{Mixed fisheries and the EU landings obligation} 

Much debate in fisheries has focussed on the need to reduce exploitation to
rebuild depleted fish populations (Worm et al). While recent evidence suggests
progress towards this goal, fisheries catches have not been increasing as would
be expected (Hilborn et al). [expand] 

Fisheries management has the goal of maximising food production from capture
fisheries (known as 'maximum sustainable yield (MSY)) while protecting all
components of the ecosystem from over-exploitation (ref). In mixed fisheries,
the predominant type of fishery worldwide, several fish species are caught
together in the same net or fishing operation; if managed by individual quotas
and species have divergent conservation goals, overexploitation of the weaker
species can result while fishers continue to catch more healthy species and
throw back ('discard') the species for which they have no quota.

The sustainability of European fisheries have been hampered by this 'mixed
fishery problem' for decades, but a paradigm shift is due to be introduced
under the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform of 2012
\cite{EuropeanParliamentandCounciloftheEuropeanUnion2013}. Two significant
management changes have been made. First, all fish stocks must be fished so as
to be able to produce their MSY by 2020; second, all fish that are caught are
due to be counted against the respective stock quota by 2019. The changes are
expected to contribute to attainment of Good Environmental Status (GES) under
the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD;
\cite{EuropeanParliament2008}) and move Europe towards an ecosystem based
approach to fisheries management [ref]. The changes are particularly
challenging for those operating in mixed fisheries, as unless fishers can avoid
catch of unwanted species they will have to stop fishing when reaching their
first restrictive quota. This introduces a potential significant cost to
fishers of under-utilised quota\cite{Hoff2010a, Ulrich2016} and provides a
strong incentive to mitigate such losses \cite{Condie2013, Condie2013a}. The
ability of fishers to align their catch with available quota depends on being
able to exploit target species while avoiding unwanted catch. Methods by which
fishers can alter their fishing patterns include by switching fishing method
(e.g. trawling to netting) and changing technical gear characteristics (e.g.
introducing escapement panels in nets), or the timing and location of fishing
activity \cite{Fulton2011b, vanPutten2012a}.

Spatio-temporal management measures (such as time-limited fishery closures)
have been applied in the past to reduce unwanted catch with varying degrees of
success (e.g. \cite{Needle2011, Holmes2011, Beare2010, Dinmore2003}) while
move-on rules have also been proposed or implemented to influence catch rates
of particular vulnerable species in order to reduce or eliminate discards
(e.g.\cite{Gardner2008, Dunn2011, Dunn2014a}). However, such measures have
generally been targeted at individual species without considering associations
and interactions among several species. The design of spatio-temporal
management measures which aim to allow exploitation of healthy stocks while
protecting weaker stocks requires understanding of the spatio-temporal
population dynamics of fish communities, a prerequisite to improving catch
composition through spatio-temporal management approaches.

\subsection{Incorporating spatial modelling advances into a single framework}

We demonstrate an approach to analysing fisheries independent survey data to
characterise the spatio-temporal dynamics of key components of a fish
community. We employ a geostatistical Vector Autoregressive Spatio-temporal
model (VAST) which includes i) a factor analysis decomposition to describe
trends in spatio-temporal dynamics of the different species as a function of
\textit{n} latent variables\cite{Thorson2015}. This allows for inference of the
distribution and density of poorly sampled species through association with the
modelled factors and identification of community dynamics and drivers common
among species groups. ii) Spatio-temporal encounter probability and catch rates
are modelled separately to allow separate characterisation of the distribution
of the species groups and densities upon encounter \cite{Thorson2015a}, iii)
Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs) are used to capture spatial and temporal
correlations within and among species for both encounter probability and catch
rates \cite{Thorson2013}, iv) the approach is set in a mixed modelling
framework to allow estimation of fixed effects to account for systematic
differences driving encounter and catches, such as gear catch rate differences,
while integrating across random effects which capture the spatio-temporal
properties of the fish community.

\subsection{Dynamics of Celtic Sea fisheries}

We use the fisheries in the Celtic Sea as a case study to understand how fish
community dynamics affect the ability of mixed fisheries to change the
composition of their catch through spatial and spatio-temporal avoidance. The
Celtic Sea is a temperate sea where a large number of species make up the
commercial catches (MORE SPECIFIC - details of landings, key species, how much
do our species contribute to overall landings?).

We parametrise our spatio-temporal model using catch data from seven fisheries
independent surveys undertaken over the period 1990 - 2015 (Table S1) and
include nine of the main commercial species: Atlantic cod (\textit{Gadus
	morhua}), Atlantic haddock (\textit{Melanogrammus aeglefinus}),
Atlantic whiting (\textit{Merlangius merlangus}), European
Hake (\textit{Merluccius merluccius}), white-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius
	piscatorius}), black-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius budegassa}),
megrim (\textit{Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis}), European Plaice
(\textit{Pleuronectes platessa}) and Common Sole (\textit{Solea solea}).  Each
species was separated into juvenile and adult size classes based on their legal
minimum conservation reference size (Table S2).

We analyse the data to understand how the different associations among
species-groups (combination of species and size class) and their potential
drivers. We consider how these have changed over time, and the implications for
mixed fisheries in managing catches of quota species under the EU's landings
obligation.

\subsection{Pearson's correlations show three distinct species-group
	associations:} 
Pearson correlation coefficients for the modelled average spatial encounter
probability (Figure 1a) show clear strong associations between adult and
juvenile size classes for all species (\textgreater 0.75 for all species except
Hake, 0.56).  Among species groups, hierarchical clustering identified three
common groups; Roundfish (cod, haddock, whiting) are found closely associated,
with correlations for adult cod with adult haddock and adult whiting of 0.73
and 0.5 respectively, while adult haddock with adult whiting was 0.63. Flatfish
(plaice and sole) are also strongly correlated with adult plaice and sole
having a coefficient of 0.75.  The final group are principally species found
along the shelf edge (hake, megrim and both anglerfish species) with the megrim
strongly associated with the budegassa anglerfish species (0.88). Negative
relationships were found between plaice and sole and the monkfish species
(-0.27, -0.26 for the adult size class with budegassa adults respectively) and
hake (-0.33, -0.37) indicating spatial separation in distributions.

Pearson's correlation coefficients for the average density (Figure 1b) show
less significant relationships then for encounter probability, but still
evident are the strong association among the roundfish with higher catches of
cod are associated with higher catches of haddock (0.58) and whiting (0.47), as
well as the two anglerfish species (0.71 for piscatorius and 0.44 for
budegassa) and hake (0.73). Similarly, plaice and sole are closely associated
(0.31) and higher catches of one would expect to see higher catches of the
other, but also higher catches of some juvenile size classes of roundfish
(whiting and haddock) and anglerfish species. Negative association of juvenile
megrim, anglerfish (budegassa) and hake with adult sole (-0.61, -0.61 and -0.47
respectively), plaice (-0.36 and -0.35 for megrim and hake only) indicate
generally high abundance of one can predict low abundance of the other
successfully.

\subsection{Spatial drivers of average species distributions and densities:}
The factor analysis decomposes the dominant spatial patterns driving
differences in encounter probability and abundance. Figure 2 shows the first
three factors for (a) average spatial encounter probability and (b) average
density. The first three factors account of 83.4 \% of the variance in
encounter probability and 69.2 \% of the variance in density, respectively. A
clear spatial pattern can been seen both for encounter probability and density,
with a positive association with the first factor in the inshore North Easterly
part of the Celtic Sea in into the Bristol Channel and Western English Channel,
moving to a negative association offshore in the south-westerly waters. On the
second factor a North / South split can be seen for encounter probability while
density is more driven by a positive association in the deeper westerly waters.
The opposite is evident on the third factor, with a positive association with
the Easterly waters for encounter probability and negative with the westerly
waters, while density is driven by a North / South split.

The strength of the loading on the first factor was highly correlated with
log(depth) for both encounter probability (-0.85, CI = -0.88 to -0.81) and
density (-0.71, CI = -0.77 to -0.65). A random forest classification tree
assigned 80 \% of the variance in the first factor for encounter probability to
depth and predominant habitat type, with the majority (86 \%) of the variance
explained by depth. The contribution of these covariates dropped to 25 \% on
the second factor with a more even split between depth and habitat, while
explaining 60 \% of the variance on the third factor. For density, the
covariates explained less of the variance with 62 \%, 35 \%, and 31 \% for each
of the factors, respectively.

It is evident that depth and to a lesser extent habitat are important
predictors of similarities and differences in species distributions and
abundances. However,.... [context, link to other studies]

\subsection{How species relationships and spatial patterns change over time:}
Pearson's correlation coefficients for spatio-temporal encounter probability
and density show similar though weaker correlations\footnote{need some evidence
	these are weaker!!} to the average values described above (Figures S1).
The average values are correlated with the spatio-temporal values indicating
generally similar relationships (0.59 (0.52 - 0.66) and 0.47 (0.38 - 0.55) for
encounter probability and density respectively) though a linear regression
shows high variance (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.36 and 0.22 respectively)
indicating that the inter-year variations in the inter-species group
correlations drive some differences in species compositions from one-year to
the next.  This can be seen in the spatial factor loadings which show subtle
differences in spatial patterns from one year to the next (Figures S2 and S3). 

However, the first two axes of the factor loadings for the spatio-temporal
encounter probability and densities show clear associations among species
group. Figure 3a shows that the same factors appear to drive spatio-temporal
distributions of megrim, anglerfish species and hake (the deeper water species,
species grouping negatively loaded on the second axes) on the one hand and the
roundfish and flatfish on the other. For spatio-temporal density (Figure 3b)
cod, haddock and whiting (the roundfish species) are separated from plaice,
sole (the flatfish) and deeper water species. As such, higher catches the other
roundfish species group would be expected when catching one species group.

\subsection{Implications for species avoidance in mixed fisheries under the
	landings obligation:}
If fisheries managed by single stock quotas under the EU's landings obligation
are to maintain productivity decoupling catches of stronger species from weaker
species will be crucial.  Methods to do this include changes to the selectivity
characteristics of gear (refs) and spatio-temporal avoidance. Both are likely
to play a role but the extent to which they can contribute to fisheries
sustainability is unknown. While here we demonstrate the separation of three
distinct species groupings (roundfish, flatfish and deeper water species)
separating catches within groups is likely to be equally as important. Figure 4 shows
the difference in spatial distribution within a group for each of the species
groupings for a single year (2015). 

Figure 4a indicates that cod had a more North-westerly distribution than
haddock while cod had more westerly distribution than whiting roughly
delineated by the 7$^{\circ}$ W line. Whiting appeared particularly
concentrated in an area between 51 and 52 $^{\circ}$ N and 5 and 7 $^{\circ}$
W, which can be seen by comparing the whiting distribution with both cod
(Figure 4b) and haddock (Figure 4c). For the deeper water species Figures 4d and 4e
indicate that hake are particularly concentrated in two areas compared to
anglerfishes\footnote{two species combined as they are managed as one} and
megrim (though for megrim, a fairly even relative distribution elsewhere is
indicated by the large amount of white space). For anglerfishes and megrim
(Figure 4f), anglerfishes have a more easterly distribution than megrim. For
the flatfish species plaice and sole (Figure 4g), Sole appear to be more
concentrated along the coastal areas of Ireland and the UK, while Plaice are
more concentrated in the Southern part of the English Channel along the coast
of France.

These nuanced differences in distribution can have important implications for
fishers seeking to fish in areas which match their quota holdings. Figure 4h
shows the predicted catch distribution from a "typical" Otter trawl gear and
Beam trawl gear fishing at three different locations. As can be seen, both the
gear selectivity and area fished play important contributions to the catch
compositions; in the inshore area (66) plaice and sole are the two main species
in catch reflecting their distribution and abundance, though the Otter trawl
gear catches a greater proportion of plaice than the Beam trawl. The area
between the UK and Ireland (79) has a greater contribution of whiting, haddock,
cod, hake and anglerfishes in the catch with the Otter trawl catching a greater
proportion of the roundfish, haddock, whiting and cod. The offshore area has a
higher contribution of megrim, anglerfishes and hake with the Otter trawl
catching a greater share of hake and the Beam trawl a greater proportion of
megrim. Megrim dominates the catch for both gears in area 216, reflecting its
relative abundance in the area.

Figure 5 shows the joint production function for the entire spatial domain,
giving the global production sets for the years 2011 - 2015. It gives the space
in which vessels have to operate where they can change the relative composition
of each species in the catch as a function of changing location fished only.
The convex hull of the space is the flexibility vessels have in order to adapt
to the changing fishing opportunities given the association of species with
each other\cite{Reimer2017}. As can be seen from Figure 5a which shows the
trade-off between cod and haddock for an Otter trawler....

Figure 5b shows the same for plaice and sole for a Beam trawler...

How far can spatial changes in targeting bring you towards achieving the right
balance of catch in mixed fisheries to maintain productivity. FOOD SECURITY!!

\section*{Methods}



The model integrates data from seven fisheries independent surveys taking
account of correlations among species-group spatio-temporal distributions and
abundances to predict spatial density estimates consistent with the resolution
of the data. 

[[Model outputs are consistent with stock-level trends abundances over time
from international assessments, yet also provide detailed insight into species
co-occurrence and the strength of associations in space and time.  We use the
outputs to draw inference on the challenges in separating catches of key
commercial demersal fish in moving to the EU landing obligation.]]
