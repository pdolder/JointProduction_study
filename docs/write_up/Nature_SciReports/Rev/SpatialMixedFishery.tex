%% Basic introduction 
Mixed fisheries are the dominant type of fishery worldwide.  Overexploitation
in mixed fisheries occurs when catches continue for available quota species
while low quota species are discarded. As EU fisheries management moves to
count all fish caught against quota (the `landings obligation'), the challenge
is to catch available quota within new constraints, else lose productivity. \\ 

%% More detailed background
A mechanism for decoupling exploitation of species caught together is spatial
targeting, which remains challenging due to complex fishery and population
dynamics. 
%% General problem
How far spatial targeting can go to practically separate species is often
unknown and anecdotal.
%% Summarising the main result
We develop a dimension-reduction framework based on joint species distribution
modelling to understand how spatial community and fishery dynamics interact to
determine species and size composition.\\

%%	 Two or three sentences explaining what the main result
In application to the highly mixed fisheries of the Celtic Sea,
clear common spatial patterns emerge for three distinct assemblages. While
distribution varies interannually, the same species are consistently
found in higher densities together, with more subtle differences within
assemblages, where spatial separation may not be practically possible.\\

%%  general context
We highlight the importance of dimension reduction techniques to focus
management discussion on axes of maximal separation and identify spatiotemporal
modelling as a scientific necessity to address the challenges of managing mixed
fisheries.

\section*{Introduction \\}
\subsection*{Mixed fisheries and the EU landings obligation \\}  

Recent efforts to reduce exploitation rates in commercial fisheries have begun
the process of rebuilding depleted fish populations\cite{Worm2009}.  Improved
management of fisheries has the potential to increase population sizes and
allow increased sustainable catches, yet fisheries catch globally remains
stagnant\cite{FAO2016}. In light of a projected increase in demand for fish
protein\cite{Bene2016} there is an important role for well managed fisheries
in supporting future food security\cite{Mcclanahan2015} necessitating
fisheries are managed efficiently to maximise productivity.\\

A particular challenge in realising increased catches from rebuilt populations
is maximising yields from mixed fisheries\cite{Branch2008, Kuriyama2016,
	Ulrich2016}. In mixed fisheries, the predominant type of fishery
worldwide, several fish species are caught together in the same net or fishing
operation (known as a `technical interaction'). If managed by individual
quotas, and catches do not match available stock quotas, either a vessel must
stop fishing when the first quota is reached (the `choke' species) or
overexploitation of the weaker species occurs while fishers continue to catch
more healthy species and throw back (`discard') the fish for which they have no
quota\cite{Batsleer2015}. There is, therefore, a pressing need for scientific
tools which simplify the complexities of mixed fisheries to help avoid
discarding. \\

Mixed fisheries require specific management approaches to avoid overfishing.
Sustainability of European fisheries has been hampered by the `mixed fishery
problem' for decades with large-scale discarding resulting\cite{Borges2015,
	Uhlmann2014}.  A paradigm shift is being introduced under the EU Common
Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform of 2012 through two significant management
changes.  First, by 2019 all fish that are caught are due to be counted against
the respective stock quota even if they are discarded; second, by 2020 all fish
stocks must be fished so as to be able to produce their Maximum Sustainable
Yield (MSY)\cite{EuropeanParliamentandCounciloftheEuropeanUnion2013}. The
changes are expected to contribute to attainment of the goal of Good
Environmental Status (GES) under the European Marine Strategy Framework
Directive (MSFD;\cite{EuropeanParliament2008}) and move Europe towards an
ecosystem based approach to fisheries management\cite{Garcia2003}. \\

Conflicts between overall management goals and drivers for individual actors
must be overcome to achieve sustainability. Societal objectives for fisheries
to achieve MSY across ecosystem components are paralleled by individual fishers
goals to maximise utility; whether that be profit, income or the continuance of
traditional practices\added[id=PD]{\cite{Holland2008}}.  Under the new policy,
unless fishers can avoid catch of unwanted species they will have to stop
fishing when reaching their first restrictive quota. This introduces a
potential significant cost to fishers of under-utilised quota\cite{Hoff2010a,
	Ulrich2016} and provides a strong incentive to mitigate such
losses\cite{Condie2013, Condie2013a}. \\

The ability to align catch with available quota depends on being able to
exploit target species while avoiding unwanted catch. Methods by which fishers
can alter their fishing patterns include by switching fishing method (e.g.
trawling to netting), changing technical gear characteristics (e.g.
introducing escapement panels in nets), or altering the timing and location of
fishing activity\cite{Fulton2011b, vanPutten2012a}.  \added[id=PD]{For
	example,} Otter trawl gears are known to have higher catch rates of
roundfish due to the higher headline and wider sweeps which herd demersal fish
into the net.  Conversely, beam trawls, which employ chain mesh to 'dig'
benthic flatfish species, have higher catch rates for these
species\cite{Fraser2008}. \added[id=PD]{Fishing location choice also has a
	significant effect of catch\cite{Gerritsen2012}, something that fishers
	routinely consider in their decision making based on their own
	knowledge.} \\

\replaced[id=PD]{Integrating spatiotemporal information from across multiple
	sources, for example, fisheries-dependent and independent survey
	data}{Design of spatiotemporal management measures} requires an
effective framework to reduce and understand the complexities of the system.
\added[id=PD]{In the past} spatiotemporal management measures (such as
time-limited fishery closures) have been applied to reduce unwanted catch with
varying degrees of success (e.g.\cite{Needle2011, Holmes2011, Beare2010,
	Dinmore2003}) while move-on rules have also been proposed or
implemented to influence catch rates of particular vulnerable species in order
to reduce or eliminate discards (e.g.\cite{Gardner2008, Dunn2011, Dunn2014a}).
However, such measures have generally been targeted at individual species
without considering associations and interactions among several species. Highly
mixed fisheries are complex with spatial, technological and community
interactions combining. The design of spatiotemporal management measures which
aim to allow exploitation of high quota stocks while protecting low quota
stocks requires understanding these interactions at a scale meaningful to
managers and fishers. Here, our goal is to develop a framework for
understanding these complexities. We do so by 1) implementing a spatiotemporal
dimension reduction method that estimates the likely correlation in catches for
multiple species at each fishing location, 2) using the results to draw
inference on the fishery-community dynamics, 3) creating a framework to
identify trends common among species, and 4) describing the potential for and
limitation of spatial measures to mitigate unwanted catches in highly mixed
fisheries.\\

\subsection*{Framework for analysing spatiotemporal mixed fisheries
	interactions \\}

We present a framework for analysing how far spatiotemporal avoidance can
contribute towards mitigating imbalances in quota in mixed fisheries. We use
fisheries-independent survey data to characterise the spatiotemporal dynamics
of key components of a fish community by employing a geostatistical Vector
Autoregressive Spatiotemporal model (VAST). We implement a factor analysis
decomposition to describe trends in spatiotemporal dynamics of the different
species as a function of latent variables\cite{Thorson2015} representing
spatial variation (9 factors; which we call 'average' spatial variation) and
spatiotemporal variation (9 factors) for encounter probability and positive
catch rates (which we call 'positive density') separately\cite{Thorson2015a}.
We use the resultant factor analysis to identify community dynamics and drivers
common among 9 species, each analysed separately for juveniles and adult
stages.  We refer to each combination of species and size class as a
"species\deleted[id=PD]{ group}", and present results through transformation of
the loading matrices using PCA rotation. \added[id=JT]{We use this PCA rotation
	to visualise a reduced number of orthogonal factors representing
	average spatial variation or spatiotemporal variation while explaining
	the majority of covariation among catch rates, as well as the
	association of each species with these maps. We refer to the
	association of each species with a given factor as its "association
	with this factor", and the value of each factor at a given location as
	its "'coefficient' at that location".} By describing the species
dynamics through underlying \deleted[id=PD]{contributory} spatiotemporal
factors we can take account of how the factors contribute to affect catches of
the species in mixed fisheries.  We use Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs)
to capture spatial and temporal dependence within and among
species\deleted[id=PD]{ groups} for both encounter probability and positive
density\cite{Thorson2013}. VAST is set in a mixed modelling framework to allow
estimation of fixed effects to account for systematic differences driving
encounter and catches, such as differences in sampling efficiency (a.k.a.
catchability), while random effects capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the
fish community.\\

\subsection*{Dynamics of Celtic Sea fisheries\\}

We use the highly mixed demersal fisheries of the Celtic Sea as a case study.
The Celtic Sea is a temperate sea where fisheries are spatially and temporally
complex; mixed fisheries are undertaken by several nations using different gear
types\cite{Ellis2000, Gerritsen2012}. Close to 150 species have been
identified in the commercial catches of the Celtic Sea, with approximately 30
species dominating the catch\cite{Mateo2016}.\\

We parametrise our spatiotemporal model using catch data from seven
fisheries-independent surveys undertaken in the Celtic Sea over the period 1990
- 2015 (Table S1) and include nine of the main commercial species: Atlantic cod
(\textit{Gadus morhua}), Atlantic haddock (\textit{Melanogrammus aeglefinus}),
Atlantic whiting (\textit{Merlangius merlangus}), European Hake
(\textit{Merluccius merluccius}), white-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius
	piscatorius}), black-bellied anglerfish (\textit{Lophius budegassa}),
megrim (\textit{Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis}), European Plaice
(\textit{Pleuronectes platessa}) and Common Sole (\textit{Solea solea}). These
species make up \textgreater 60 \% of landings by towed fishing gears for the
area (average 2011 - 2015\cite{STECF2017}). Each species was separated into
juvenile and adult size classes based on their legal minimum conservation
reference size (Table S2).\\

We analyse the data to understand how the different associations among species
(combination of species and size class) \replaced[id=PD]{form distinct
	assemblages with common drivers of spatiotemporal distributions, and
	how these affect}{ and their potential drivers affect} catch
compositions \added[id=PD]{for fishers operating} in mixed fisheries. We
consider how these have changed over time, and the implications for mixed
fisheries in managing catches of quota species under the EU landing
obligation.\\

\section*{Results\\}

\added[id=PD]{Using our general framework we identify, with relatively few
	factors from a spatial dynamic factor analysis, that the Celtic Sea
	demersal fish community can be partitioned into three species
	assemblages (roundfish, flatfish and deeper water species). These
	assemblages show common trends in spatiotemporal distributions in
	encounter probability and positive density which can be partitioned
	into time invariant ("average effect") spatial trends and time variant
	("spatiotemporal") trends. We show through presentation of factor
	coefficients that time invariant trends may be linked to physical
	characteristics of the system including depth and predominant substrate
	type, while species loadings on to time varying spatial trends show
	that the temporal changes in distribution of species assemblages are
	affected a similar way. We demonstrate how this information can be used
	to help inform spatial targeting and avoidance of the different
	assemblages. While more nuanced differences in spatiotemporal
	distributions exist within an assemblage, which presents a greater
	challenge to spatially separate catches, we show how this information
	may be utilised by mangers and fishers to match catch to quota in
	highly mixed fisheries through changes in gear and location fished.}

\subsection*{Common \deleted[id=PD]{average spatial patterns} driv\replaced{ers
		for groups of}{ing} species \replaced[id=PD]{determining
		spatial distributions}{associations}\\} A spatial dynamic
factor analysis \added[id=PD]{was used to} decompose\deleted[id=PD]{s} the
dominant spatial patterns driving differences in average spatial variation.
The first three factors (after PCA rotation) account for 83.7 \% of the between
species variance in the probability of encountering a species (the "average
encounter probability") and 69 \% of the explained variance in catch rates on
encounter ("average positive density"). A clear spatial pattern can been seen
both for \added[id=PD]{average} encounter probability and
\added[id=PD]{average} positive density, with a positive
\added[id=PD]{coefficient} value associated with the first factor in the
inshore north easterly part of the Celtic Sea into the Bristol Channel and
Western English Channel, moving to a negative \added[id=PD]{coefficient} value
offshore in the south-westerly waters (Figure 1).  The species loadings
\deleted[id=PD]{coefficients} show plaice, sole and whiting to be positively
associated with the first factor for \added[id=PD]{average} encounter
probability while the other species are negatively associated. For average
positive density, positive associations are also found for haddock and juvenile
cod. This is indicative of a more inshore distribution for these species.\\ 

On the second spatial factor for \added[id=PD]{average} encounter probability a
north / south split can be seen at approximately 49$^{\circ}$ N while positive
density is more driven by a positive \replaced[id=PD]{coefficient}{value} in
the deeper westerly waters as well as some inshore areas. Species
\replaced[id=PD]{loadings}{values} for the second factor indicate there are
positive associations for juvenile monkfish (\emph{L.  piscatorius}), juvenile
hake, juvenile megrim, plaice and juvenile whiting with average positive
density, which may reflect two different spatial distributions in the more
offshore and in the inshore areas (Figure 1).\\

On the third factor, there is a positive \replaced[id=PD]{coefficient
	for}{association with} the easterly waters for encounter probability
and negative \added[id=PD]{coefficient} with the westerly waters. This splits
the roundfish species (cod, haddock and whiting, which all have a positive
association with the third factor for average encounter probability) from the
rest of the species (which have a negative association). Positive density is
driven by a north / south split (Figure 1), with positive
\added[id=PD]{coefficient} values in the northerly areas. Juvenile monkfish
(\emph{L.  budgessa} and \emph{L.  piscatorius}), cod, juvenile haddock, hake,
adult plaice and whiting are also positively associated with the third factor
towards the north while adult monkfish (\emph{L. budgessa} and \emph{L.
	piscatorius}), adult haddock, megrims, juvenile plaice and sole
\replaced[id=PD]{have negative loadings}{are negatively associated} reflecting
their more southerly distribution (Figure 1).\\

While this exploratory factor analysis is modelling unobserved drivers of
distribution, we considered what might be driving the differences seen in the
spatial factor \added[id=PD]{coefficients and species} loadings. The first
factor was highly correlated with log(depth) for both \added[id=PD]{average}
encounter probability \added[id=PD]{coefficients} (-0.85, CI = -0.88 to -0.81;
Figure S1) and \added[id=PD]{average} positive density
\added[id=PD]{coefficients} (-0.71, CI = -0.77 to -0.65; Figure S2). A random
forest classification tree assigned 80 \% of the variance in the first factor
for \added[id=PD]{average} encounter probability to depth and predominant
substrate type, with the majority (86 \%) of the variance explained by depth.
The variance explained by these variables dropped to 25 \% on the second factor
with a more even split between depth and substrate, while explaining 60 \% of
the variance on the third factor.  For \added[id=PD]{average} positive density,
the variables explained less of the variance with 62 \%, 35 \%, and 31 \% for
each of the factors, respectively.\\

It is clear that depth and to a lesser extent substrate are important
predictors for the main driver of similarities and differences in distributions
and abundances for the different species. The first factor correlates
strongly with these variables, despite them not explicitly being incorporated
in the model. While depth was incorporated as a covariate in an alternative
model formulation (see Methods), it was found not to improve predictions. The
utility of these variables as predictors of species distributions has been
identified in other marine species distribution models \cite{Robinson2011}; the
advantage to the approach taken here is that, where such data is unavailable at
appropriate spatial resolution, the spatial factor analysis can adequately
characterise these influences on species spatial dynamics.\\

\subsection*{\replaced[id=JT]{Three assemblages show similar spatiotemporal
		patterns}{Time-varying species distributions, but stability within
	\added[id=PD]{identifiable} assemblages}\\} 
While there are clear spatial patterns in the factor coefficients describing
differences in average \deleted[id=PD]{ (over time)} encounter probability and
positive density (Figure 1), the interannual differences in factor coefficients
show less structure (Figures S5, S6). These interannual differences are
important as they reflect the ability of fishers to predict where they can
target \added[id=PD]{or avoid} species from one year to the next, without which
it may be difficult to \added[id=PD]{balance catches with available quota and}
avoid unwanted catch.\\

\replaced[id=PD]{S}{While s}patiotemporal factor coefficients \added[id=PD]{for
	encounter probability and positive density} did not show
\replaced[id=PD]{the same spatial pattern driving species
	distributions}{consistent trends} from year to year
\deleted[id=PD]{across all species,} \added[id=PD]{but correlation} among
species \replaced[id=PD]{showed}{there were} clear relationships
\added[id=PD]{in species association with spatiotemporal factor coefficients
	resulting in the formation of three different assemblages} (Figure
2).  The same factors appear to drive spatiotemporal \added[id=PD]{(interannual
	changes in)} distributions of megrim, anglerfish species and hake (the
deeper water species, \deleted[id=PD]{assemblages} \added[id=PD]{forming an
	assemblage} negatively associated with the second axes of Figure 2) and
the roundfish and flatfish (\added[id=PD]{two} assemblages\deleted[id=PD]{ing}
more positively associated with the second axes of Figure 2a). For
spatiotemporal positive density (Figure 2b) cod, haddock and whiting (the
roundfish species) are separated from plaice, sole (the flatfish) and deeper
water \replaced[id=PD]{assembalge}{species\added[id=PD]{-group}}. As such, it
can be predicted that higher catches of a species within a
\replaced[id=PD]{assemblage}{\added[id=PD]{species-}group} (e.g. cod in
roundfish) would be expected when catching another species within that
\replaced[id=PD]{assemblage}{\added[id=PD]{species-}group} (e.g.  whiting in
roundfish). This suggests that one or more common environmental drivers are
influencing the distributions of the \replaced[id=PD]{assemblages}{species
	groups}, and that driver differentially affects the
\replaced[id=PD]{different assemblages}{species groups}.  Temperature is often
included as a covariate in species distribution models, but was found not to
contribute to the variance in the first factor
\replaced[id=PD]{coefficients}{values} (Figure S6, no correlations found for
either \added[id=PD]{spatiotemporal} encounter probability or positive density)
and so was not included as a covariate in the final model.\\

\subsection*{Three \replaced[id=PD]{different species assemblages}{clusters of
		species} show similar spatial
	\replaced[id=PD]{covariance}{patterns}\\} In order to gain greater
insight into the community dynamics we considered how species covary in space
and time through correlations among species.  Pearson correlation coefficients
for the modelled average spatial encounter probability (Figure 3a) show clear
strong associations between adult and juvenile size classes for all species
(\textgreater 0.75 for all species except hake, 0.56).  Among species,
hierarchical clustering identified the same three common
\added[id=PD]{species-}groups as our visual inspection of factor loadings
above, with roundfish (cod, haddock, whiting) closely grouped
\deleted[id=PD]{in their association}, with correlations for adult cod with
adult haddock and adult whiting of 0.73 and 0.5 respectively, while adult
haddock with adult whiting was 0.63 (Figure 3a). Flatfish (plaice and sole) are
also strongly correlated with adult plaice and sole having a coefficient of
0.75.  The final group are principally the species found in the deeper waters
(hake, megrim and both anglerfish species) with the megrim strongly associated
with the budegassa anglerfish species (0.88). Negative relationships were found
between plaice and sole, and the monkfish species (-0.27, -0.26 for the adult
size class with budegassa adults respectively) and hake (-0.33, -0.37) (Figure
3a) indicating spatial separation in distributions \added[id=PD]{,with the
	flatfish found more inshore}. This
\replaced[id=PD]{underscores}{confirms} the
\replaced[id=JT]{correlations}{associations} among species seen in
\added[id=JT]{associations of each species with} \replaced[id=JT]{factors}{the
	factor loadings}, with three distinct assemblages being
\replaced[id=PD]{confirmed}{present}.\\

Correlation coefficients for the average positive density (Figure 3b) show
fewer significant positive or negative relationships among species then for
encounter probability, but still evident are the strong
\replaced[id=JT]{correlation}{association} among the roundfish with higher
catches of cod \deleted[id=PD]{are} \replaced[id=JT]{correlated}{associated}
with higher catches of haddock (0.58) and whiting (0.47), as well as the two
anglerfish species (0.71 for piscatorius and 0.44 for budegassa) and hake
(0.73). Similarly, plaice and sole are closely
\replaced[id=JT]{correlated}{associated} (0.31) and higher catches of one would
expect to see higher catches of the other, but also higher catches of some
juvenile size classes of roundfish (whiting and haddock) and anglerfish
species. Negative \replaced[id=JT]{correlation}{association} of juvenile
megrim, anglerfish (budegassa) and hake with adult sole (-0.61, -0.61 and -0.47
respectively), plaice (-0.36 and -0.35 for megrim and hake only) indicate high
catches of one can predict low catches of the other successfully.\\

\replaced[id=PD]{We sought to understand how stable relationships between

temporally changing environmental factors and species behaviour.\\


\subsection*{Subtle differences in distributions may be important to separate
	catches within groups under the landing obligation:\\} The analysis
shows the interdependence within \added[id=PD]{three} assemblages of
roundfish, flatfish and deeper water species, where catching one species within
the group indicates a high probability of catching the other
species\replaced[id=PD]{. This}{, which} has important implications for how
spatial avoidance can be used to support implementation of the EU's landings
obligation. If production from mixed fisheries is to be maximised, decoupling
catches of species between and within the groups will be key. For example,
asking where the maximal separation in the densities of two coupled species is
likely to occur? To address this requirement, we map the difference in spatial
distribution within a \added[id=PD]{species-}group for each pair of
species\deleted[id=PD]{ within an assemblage} for a single year (2015;
Figure 4). \\

Cod had a more north-westerly distribution than haddock \replaced[id=PD]{and
	a}{, while cod was} more westerly distributed than whiting roughly
delineated by the 7$^{\circ}$ W line (Figure 4a). Whiting appeared particularly
concentrated in an area between 51 and 52 $^{\circ}$ N and 5 and 7 $^{\circ}$
W, which can be seen by comparing the whiting distribution with both cod
(Figure 4b) and haddock (Figure 4c). For the deeper water species hake are more
densely distributed in two \replaced[id=PD]{locations around 10 W and 48 N and
	12 W and 50 N}{areas} compared to the anglerfish species
(\replaced[id=PD]{anglerfishes have been presented together}{which are
	combined} as they are jointly managed under a single quota) and megrim
\added[id=PD]{which were more widely spatially distributed}(Figures 4d, and
4e). Megrim has a fairly stable density across the modelled area as indicated
by the large amount of white space in Figures 4e. For anglerfishes and megrim
(Figure 4f), anglerfishes have a more easterly distribution than megrim.  For
the flatfish species plaice and sole (Figure 4g), plaice appear to be more
densely distributed along the coastal areas of Ireland and Britain, while sole
are more densely distributed in the Southern part of the English Channel along
the coast of France.\\

Predicted catch distribution from a ``typical'' otter trawl gear and beam trawl
fishing at three different locations highlights the differences fishing gear
makes on catches (Figure 4h). As can be seen, both the gear selectivity and
\replaced[id=PD]{location}{area} fished play important contributions to the
catch compositions; in the inshore area (location 'A') plaice and sole are the
two main species in \added[id=PD]{the} catch reflecting their distribution and
abundance, though the otter trawl gear catches a greater proportion of plaice
to sole than the beam trawl.  The area between Britain and Ireland (location
'B') has a greater contribution of whiting, haddock, cod, hake and anglerfishes
in the catch with the otter trawl catching a greater proportion of the
roundfish, haddock, whiting and cod while the beam trawl catches more
anglerfishes and megrims. The offshore area has a higher contribution of
megrim, anglerfishes and hake with the otter trawl catching a greater share of
hake and the beam trawl a greater proportion of megrim. Megrim dominates the
catch for both gears in location 'C', reflecting its relative abundance in the
area \added[id=PD]{irrespective of the gear deployed}.  \\

\section*{Discussion\\}

Our study is framed by the problem of addressing the scientific challenges of
implementing the landing obligation for mixed fisheries. In application to the
Celtic Sea, we have identified spatial separation of three distinct
assemblages (roundfish, flatfish and deeper water species) while showing
that only subtle differences exist in distributions within assemblages. The
differences in catch compositions between gears at the same location (Figure
4h) show that changing fishing methods can go some way to affecting catch, yet
that differences in catches between locations are likely to be more important.
For example, beam trawls fishing at the inshore locations (e.g. location 'A' in
Figure 4) are likely to predominately catch plaice and sole, yet switching to
the offshore locations (e.g. location 'C') would likely yield greater catches
of megrim and anglerfishes.  Such changes in spatial fishing patterns are
likely to play an important role in supporting implementation of the landings
obligation.\\

More challenging is within-group spatial separation due to significant overlap
in spatial distributions for the species, driven by common environmental
factors. Subtle changes may yield some benefit in changing catch composition,
yet the outcome is likely to be much more difficult to predict. For example,
subtle differences in the distribution of cod, haddock and whiting can be seen
in Figures 4a-c, showing spatial separation of catches is much more challenging
and likely to need to be supported by other measures such as changes to the
selectivity characteristics of gear\cite{Santos2016}. \added[id=PD]{For example
	we identified a spatial overlap of flatfish with juvenile roundfish in
	our species correlations (Figure 3); reducing catches of incidential
	bycatch on the main target fishing grounds will likely require
	adaptations to fishing gear to address bycatch without significant
	economic impacts on the fishery.}\\

A role that science can play in supporting effectiveness of spatiotemporal
avoidance could be to provide probabilistic advice on hotspots for species
occurrence and high species density which can inform fishing decisions.
Previous modelling studies have shown how spatiotemporal models could improve
predictions of high ratios of bycatch species to target species\cite{Ward2015,
	Cosandey-Godin2015, Breivik2016}, and geostatistical models are well
suited to this as they incorporate spatial dependency while providing for
probabilities to be drawn from posterior distributions of the parameter
estimates. We posit that such advice \added[id=PD]{on "hot spots" as a
	supportive measure to icentivise avoidance of areas of high bycatch
	risk} could be enhanced by integrating data obtained directly from
commercial fishing vessels rapidly while modeling densities at small time
scales (e.g., weekly).  Short-term forecasts of distribution could inform
fishing choices while also capturing seasonal differences in distributions,
akin to weather forecasting.  Advice informed by a model including a seasonal
or real-time component could inform optimal policies for time-area closures,
move-on rules or even as informal information to be utilised by fishers
directly without the need for costly continuous data collection on
environmental parameters, but by using the "vessels-as-laboratories"
approach.\\

An important question for the implementation of the EU's landing obligation is
how far spatial avoidance can go to achieving catch balancing in fisheries.
Our model captures differences between location fished for two gear types and
their broad scale effect on catch composition, information crucial for managers
in implementing the landing obligation. It is likely, however, that this
analysis reflects a lower bound on the utility of spatial avoidance as
fine-scale behavioural decisions such as time-of-day, gear configuration and
location choices can also be used to affect catch\cite{Abbott2015,
	Thorson2016}. Results of empirical studies undertaken
elsewhere\cite{Branch2008, Kuriyama2016} suggest limits to the effectiveness of
spatial avoidance. Differences in ability to change catch composition have also
been observed for different fleets; in the North Sea targeting ability was
found to differ between otter and beam trawlers as well as between vessels of
different sizes\cite{Pascoe2007}. \\

\added[id=PD]{Further, under the landing obligation the balance of risk-reward
	for trip level fishing decisions about where to fish may change. For
	example, are fishers likely to fish in "safe" areas where its known
	there are lower catches of the target species but also decreased risk
	of encountering bycatch? How do decisions about level of risk affect
	likelihood of overshooting available quota and potential profit and
	losses for individual trips? Set in this context, the
	\deleted[id=JT]{model} parameter estimates could be used to simulate
	from a distribution of catches in the fishery at different locations
	and therefore inform on the possibility of extreme catch events and
	potential consequences for overshooting quotas. This information may be
	of interest in identifying optimum strategies, or used in future work
	to model closure risks for fisheries operating in different locations
	and conditions given quota constraints. Such analysis on risk and
	decision making is likely to hinge on micro-level decisions by fishers
	and such study would be an interesting compliment to broader scale
	considerations such as those detailed here.} \\

Our framework allows for a quantitative understanding of the broad scale global
production set available to fishers\cite{Reimer2017} and thus the extent to
which they can alter catch compositions while operating in a mixed fishery.
Simulations of spatial effort allocation scenarios based on the production sets
derived from the model estimates could be used as inputs to fisher behavioural
models to allow for identification of the lower bounds of optimum spatial
harvest strategies. \replaced[id=PD]{Modelling of different spatial strategies
	at the individual or fishery level}{This} would provide managers with
information useful for examining trade-offs in quota setting by integrating
potential for spatial targeting in changing catch composition, thus provide a
scientific contribution to \added[id=PD]{assessing the ability of technical
	measures for} meeting the goal of maximising catches in mixed fisheries
within single stock quota constraints\cite{Ulrich2016}. Further, the
correlations among species could provide information on fisheries at risk of
capturing protected, endangered or threatened species such as elasmobranches,
and allow identification of areas where there are high ratios of protected to
target species.\\


Complex environmental, fishery and community drivers of distribution for groups
of species highlights the scale of the challenge in separating catches within
the assemblages using spatial management measures. This has important
implications for management of the mixed fisheries under the EU landings
obligation. Our analysis identifies where it may be easier to separate catches
of species (among groups) and where it is more challenging (within groups). We
propose that the framework presented in Figures 1-4 provides a viable route to
reducing the complexity of highly mixed systems.  This can allow informed
management discussion over more traditional anecdotal knowledge of
single-species distribution in space and time.\\


\section*{Methods\\}

\subsection*{Model structure:\\} 

VAST (Software in the R statistical programming language can be found here:
\url{www.github.com/james-thorson/VAST}) implements a delta-generalised linear
mixed modelling (GLMM) framework that takes account of spatiotemporal
correlations among species through implementation of a spatial dynamic factor
analysis (SDFA). Spatial variation is captured through a Gaussian Markov Random
Field, while we model random variation among species and years. Covariates
affecting catchability (to account for differences between fishing surveys) and
density (to account for environmental preferences) can be incorporated for
predictions of presence and positive density. The following briefly summarises
the key methods implemented in the VAST framework. For full details see Thorson
\textit{et al} 2017\cite{Thorson2017}.\\

\textbf{\textit{SDFA:}} A spatial dynamic factor analysis incorporates advances
in joint dynamic species models\cite{Thorson2017} to take account of
associations among species by modelling response variables as a multivariate
process. This is achieved through implementing a factor analysis decomposition
where common latent trends are estimated so that the number of common trends is
less than the number of species modelled. The factor coefficients are then
associated through a function for each factor that returns a positive or
negative association of one or more species with any location. Log-density of
any species is then be described as a linear combination of factors and
loadings: \begin{equation} \theta_{c}(s,t) = \sum_{j=1}^{n_{j}}
	L_{c,j}\psi_{j}(s,t) +\sum_{k=1}^{n_{k}} \gamma_{k,c}\chi_{k}(s,t)
\end{equation} Where $\theta_{c}(s,t)$ represents log-density for species $c$
at site $s$ at time $t$, $\psi_{j}$ is the coefficient for factor $j$,
$L_{c,j}$ the loading matrix representing association of species $c$ with
factor $j$ and $\gamma_{k,c}\chi_{k}(s,t)$ the linear effect of covariates at
each site and time\cite{Thorson2016b}. \\

The factor analysis can summarize community dynamics and identify which species
and life-stages have similar spatiotemporal patterns. This allows inference
regarding species distributions and abundance of poorly sampled species through
association with other species, and also provides estimates of spatiotemporal
correlations among species\cite{Thorson2016b}.\\

\textbf{\textit{Estimation of abundances:}} Spatiotemporal encounter
probability and positive catch rates are modelled separately with
spatiotemporal encounter probability modelled using a logit-link linear
predictor;
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{split}
			logit[p(s_{i},c_{i},t_{i})] =	\beta_{p}(c_{i},t_{i}) +
			& \sum\limits_{f=1}^{n_{\omega}} L_{\omega}(c_{i},f)
			\omega_{p}(s_{i},f) + \sum\limits_{f=1}^{n_{\varepsilon}}
			L_{\varepsilon}(c_{i},f) \varepsilon_{p}(s_{i},f,t_{i}) + \\ 
			& \sum\limits_{v=1}^{n_{v}}\delta_{p}(v)Q_{p}(c_{i}, v_{i})
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}

and positive catch rates modelling using a gamma- distribution\cite{Thorson2015a}. 
		\begin{equation}
			\begin{split}
			log[r(s_{i},c_{i},t_{i})] = \beta_{r}(c_{i},t_{i}) +
			& \sum\limits_{f=1}^{n_{\omega}} L_{\omega}(c_{i},f)
			\omega_{r}(s_{i},f) +\sum\limits_{f=1}^{n_{\varepsilon}} 
			L_{\varepsilon}(c_{i},f) \varepsilon_{r}(s_{i},f,t_{i}) + \\
			& \sum\limits_{v=1}^{n_{v}}\delta_{r}(v) Q_{r}(c_{i}, v_{i})
			\end{split}
		\end{equation}

where $p(s_{i}, c_{i}, t_{i})$ is the predictor for encounter probability for
observation $i$, at location $s$ for species $c$ and time $t$ and
$r(s_{i}, c_{i}, t_{i})$ is similarly the predictor for the positive density.
$\beta_{*}(c_{i},t_{i})$ is the intercept, $\omega_{*}(s_{i},c_{i})$ the
spatial variation at location $s$ for factor $f$, with $L_{\omega}(c_{i},f)$
the loading matrix for spatial covariation among species.
$\varepsilon_{*}(s_{i},c_{i},t_{i})$ is the linear predictor for
spatiotemporal variation, with $L_{\varepsilon}(c_{i}, f)$ the loading matrix
for spatiotemporal covariance among species and $\delta_{*}(c_{i},
v_{i})$ the contribution of catchability covariates for the linear predictor
with $Q_{c_{i}, v_{i}}$ the catchability covariates for species $c$ and
vessel $v$;  $*$ can be either $p$ for probability of encounter or $r$ for
positive density.\\

The Delta-Gamma formulation is then:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	& Pr(C = 0) = 1 - p \\
	& Pr(C = c | c > 0) = p \cdot \frac{\lambda^{k}c^{k-1} \cdot exp(-\lambda c)}{\Gamma_{k}}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

for the probability $p$ of a non-zero catch $C$ given a gamma distribution for
for the positive catch with a rate parameter $\lambda$ and shape parameter
$k$.\\

\textbf{\textit{Spatiotemporal variation:}} The spatiotemporal variation is
modelled using Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) where observations are
correlated in space through a Matérn covariance function with the parameters
estimated within the model. Here, the correlation decays smoothly over space
the further from the location and includes geometric anisotropy to reflect the
fact that correlations may decline in one direction faster than another (e.g.
moving offshore)\cite{Thorson2013}.  The best fit estimated an anisotropic
covariance where the correlations were stronger in a north-east - south-west
direction, extending approximately 97 km and 140 km before correlations for
encounter probability and positive density reduced to \textless 10 \%,
respectively (Figure S10).  Incorporating the spatiotemporal correlations among
and species provides more efficient use of the data as inference can be made
about poorly sampled locations from the covariance structure.\\

A probability distribution for spatiotemporal variation in both encounter
probability and positive catch rate was specified, $\varepsilon_{*}(s,p,t)$,
with a three-dimensional multivariate normal distribution so that:
	\begin{equation}
		vec[\mathbf{E}_{*}(t)] \sim MVN(0,\mathbf{R}_{*} \otimes
		\mathbf{V}_{{\varepsilon}{*}})
	\end{equation}

Here, $vec[\mathbf{E}_{*}(t)]$ is the stacked columns of the matrices
describing $\varepsilon{*}(s,p,t)$ at every location, species and time,
$\mathbf{R}_{*}$ is a correlation matrix for encounter probability or positive
catch rates among locations and $\mathbf{V}_{*}$ a covariance matrix for
encounter probability or positive catch rate among species (modelled
within the factor analysis). $\otimes$ represents the Kronecker product so that
the correlation among any location and species can be
computed\cite{Thorson2017}.\\
		
\textbf{\textit{Incorporating covariates}} Survey catchability (the relative
efficiency of a gear catching a species) was estimated as a fixed effect
in the model, $\delta_{s}(v)$, to account for differences in spatial fishing
patterns and gear characteristics which affect encounter and capture
probability of the sampling gear\cite{Thorson2014}. Parameter estimates
(Figure S11) showed clear differential effects of surveys using otter trawl
gears (more effective for round fish species) and beam trawl gears (more
effective for flatfish species).\\

No fixed covariates for habitat quality or other predictors of encounter
probability or positive density were included. While incorporation may improve
the spatial predictive performance\cite{Thorson2017}, it was not found to be
the case here based on model selection with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).\\

\textbf{\textit{Parameter estimation}} Parameter estimation was undertaken
through Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for fixed effects
while integrating the joint likelihood (which includes the probability of the
random effects) with respect to random effects. This was implemented using
Template Model Builder (TMB;\cite{Kristensen2015}) with computation through
support by the Irish Centre for High End Computing (ICHEC;
\url{https://www.ichec.ie}) facility.  \\

\subsection*{Data\\}

The model integrates data from seven fisheries-independent surveys taking
account of correlations among species spatiotemporal distributions and
abundances to predict spatial density estimates consistent with the resolution
of the data. \\

The model was fitted to nine species separated into adult and juvenile size
classes (Table S2) to seven survey series (Table S1) in the Celtic Sea bound by
48$^{\circ}$ N to 52 $^{\circ}$ N latitude and 12 $^{\circ}$ W to 2$^{\circ}$ W
longitude (Figure S8) for the years 1990 - 2015 inclusive. \\

The following steps were undertaken for data processing: i) data for survey
stations and catches were downloaded from ICES Datras
(\url{www.ices.dk/marine-data/data-portals/Pages/DATRAS.aspx}) or obtained
directly from the Cefas Fishing Survey System (FSS); ii) data were checked and
any tows with missing or erroneously recorded station information (e.g. tow
duration or distance infeasible) removed; iii) swept area for each of the
survey tows was estimated based on fitting a GAM to gear variables so that
Doorspread = s(Depth) + DoorWt + WarpLength + WarpDiameter + SweepLength and a
gear specific correction factor taken from the literature\cite{Piet2009}; iii)
fish lengths were converted to biomass (Kg) through estimating a von
bertalanffy length weight relationship, $Wt = a \cdot L^{b}$, fit to sampled
length and weight of fish obtained in the EVHOE survey and aggregated within
size classes (adult and juvenile). \added[id=PD]{Details on the downloading and
	processing of the data are available in Rmarkdown format (code and
	steps combined) as supplementary material.} \\

The final dataset comprised of estimates of catches (including zeros) for each
station and species and estimated swept area for the tow.\\

\subsection*{Data availability\\}

Data used to fit the model is available via the ICES Datras data portal
(\url{http://www.ices.dk/marine-data/data-portals/Pages/DATRAS.aspx}) for two
surveys and on request to the author for the remaining five surveys.\\

\subsection*{Model setup\\}

The spatial domain was setup to include 250 knots representing the Gaussian
Random Fields. The model was configured to estimate nine factors each to describe
the spatial and spatiotemporal encounter probability and positive density
parameters, with a logit-link for the linear predictor for encounter
probability and log-link for the linear predictor for positive density, with an
assumed gamma distribution.\\

Three candidate models were identified, i) a base model where the vessel
interaction was a random effect, ii) the base but where the vessel x species
effect was estimated as a fixed covariate, iii) with vessel x species effect
estimated, but with the addition of estimating fixed density covariates for
both predominant habitat type at a knot and depth. AIC and BIC model selection
favoured the second model (Table S3). The final model included estimating 1,674
fixed parameters and predicting 129,276 random effect values.\\

\subsection*{Model validation\\}

Q-Q plots show good fit between the derived estimates and the data for positive
catch rates and between the predicted and observed encounter probability (S12,
S13).  Further, model outputs are consistent with stock-level trends abundances
over time from international assessments (S14), yet also provide detailed
insight into species co-occurrence and the strength of associations in space
and time. \\
