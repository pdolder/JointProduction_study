	\deleted{Mixed fisheries capture a mix of species at the same time and are the dominant
type of fishery worldwide. }Overexploitation in mixed fisheries occurs when
catches continue for available quota species while low quota species are
discarded\deleted{\cite{Batsleer2015}}. As EU fisheries management moves to count all fish
caught against quota (the `landings obligation'), the challenge is to catch
available quota within new constraints\deleted{, else lose productivity}.
%% More detailed background
A mechanism for decoupling exploitation of species caught together is spatial
targeting, \replaced[id = Paul]{which is}{but this remains} challenging due to
complex \added{spatiotemporal} fishery and population
dynamics\deleted{in space and time}\deleted{\cite{Branch2008, Dunn2014a}}.

unknown and anecdotal.}
%% Summarising the main result
\deleted{Here w}\added{W}e develop a dimension-reduction framework \deleted{based on joint species
distribution modelling (spatial dynamic factor analysis)}to understand how
spatial community and fishery dynamics\deleted{interact to} determine species and size

\deleted{Recent} Efforts to reduce exploitation rates in commercial fisheries
have begun the process of rebuilding depleted fish populations\cite{Worm2009}.
Improved fisheries management\deleted{has the potential to} can increase
population sizes and allow increased sustainable catches, yet fisheries catch
globally remains static\cite{FAO2016}. With future increased demand for fish
protein\deleted{\cite{B??n??2016}} there is an important role for well managed
fisheries in supporting future food
security\cite{Mcclanahan2015}\deleted[id=coilin]{and}\deleted{there}
\replaced[id=coilin]{necessitating}{remains a need to ensure} fisheries are
managed efficiently to maximise productivity.

A\deleted[id = brutus]{particular} challenge in realising increased catches
from rebuilt populations is maximising yields from mixed
fisheries\cite{Branch2008, Kuriyama2016, Ulrich2016}. In mixed
fisheries\deleted{, the predominant type of fishery worldwide, several fish
	species are caught together in the same net or fishing operation
	\deleted{(known as a `technical inteaction')}. If} managed by
individual quotas, \replaced[id = brutus]{if}{and} catches do not match
available stock quotas, either a vessel must stop fishing when the first quota
is reached (the `choke' species) or overexploitation of the weaker species
occurs while fishers\deleted{continue to} catch more healthy species and throw
back (`discard') the fish for which they have no quota\cite{Batsleer2015}.
There is\deleted{, therefore,} a pressing need for scientific tools that
simplify the complexities of mixed fisheries to help \replaced[id =
coilin]{avoid discarding}{managers and fishers maximise catches}. 

Sustainability of European fisheries has been hampered by this `mixed fishery
problem' for decades with large-scale discarding\cite{Uhlmann2014}.\deleted{A
	paradigm shift is being introduced} Under the EU Common Fisheries
Policy (CFP) reform of 2012\deleted{through two significant management changes.
	First}, by 2019 all fish that are caught are due to be counted against
the respective stock quota\deleted{; second, by 2020 all fish stocks must be
	fished so as to be able to produce their Maximum Sustainable Yield
	(MSY)\cite{EuropeanParliamentandCounciloftheEuropeanUnion2013}. The
	changes are}\deleted[id = coilin]{, expected to contribute to
	attainment of the goal of Good Environmental Status (GES) under the
	European Marine Strategy Framework Directive
	(MSFD;\cite{EuropeanParliament2008}) and move Europe towards an
	ecosystem based approach to fisheries management\cite{Garcia2003}}.
\deleted{Societal objectives for fisheries to achieve MSY across ecosystem
	components are paralleled by}\deleted{Individual fishers goals
	%\added[id = coilin]{are to} maximise utility; whether that be profit,
	%income or the
continuance of traditional practices.}\deleted{Under the new policy,}Unless
fishers can avoid catch of unwanted species they will have to stop fishing when
reaching their first restrictive quota,\deleted{. This} introducing
a\deleted{potential} significant cost to\deleted{fishers of} under-utilised
quota\cite{Ulrich2016} and\deleted{provides} strong incentive to mitigate such
losses\cite{Condie2013}. 

The ability\deleted{of fishers} to align \deleted{their}catch with available
quota depends on being able to exploit target species while avoiding unwanted
catch,\deleted{ Methods by which fishers can alter their fishing patterns
	include} either by switching fishing method\deleted{(e.g.  trawling to
	netting)}, changing technical gear characteristics\deleted{(e.g.
	introducing escapement panels in nets)}, or the timing and location of
fishing activity\cite{vanPutten2012a}. \deleted{For example, otter trawl gears
	are known to have higher catch rates of roundfish due to the higher
	headline and wider sweeps which herd demersal fish into the net while
	beam trawls employ chain mesh to
	%\replaced[id = coilin]{lift}{'dig'} benthic flatfish species from the
	seabed\cite{Fraser2008}.}Spatiotemporal\deleted{management}
measures\deleted{(such as time-limited fishery closures)} have been applied to
reduce unwanted catch with varying degrees of success\cite{Needle2011,
	Dunn2014a}, \added{partly because}\deleted{However, such measures}
\added{they} have \deleted{generally}been targeted at individual species
without considering associations\deleted{and interactions} among several
species. Highly mixed fisheries are complex with spatial, technological and
community interactions\deleted{combining}; \deleted{The design of
	spatio-temporal management measures which aim to allow exploitation of
	high quota stocks while protecting low quota stocks requires
	understanding of these interactions at a scale meaningful to managers
	and fishers.}\deleted{Here,}our goal is to develop a framework for
understanding these complexities. We do so by 1) implementing a spatiotemporal
dimension reduction method, 2) using\deleted{the} results to draw inference on
the fishery-community dynamics, 3) creating a framework to identify trends common
among species\deleted{. We use this to}, and 4) describing \replaced[id =
coilin]{the potential for and limitations of}{where} spatial measures
\replaced[id = coilin]{to}{can contribute to} mitigate\deleted{ing} unwanted
catches in highly mixed fisheries.

\deleted{We present a framework for analysing how far spatio-temporal avoidance
	can contribute towards mitigating imbalances in quota in mixed
	fisheries.} We \deleted{use fisheries-independent survey data to}
characterise the spatiotemporal dynamics of key components of a fish community
by \deleted{employing a geostatistical Vector Autoregressive Spatiotemporal
	model (VAST). We}implement\added{ing} a factor analysis decomposition
to describe trends in spatiotemporal dynamics of the different species as a
function of latent variables\cite{Thorson2015} representing spatial variation
(9 factors;\deleted{which we call} 'average' spatial variation) and
spatio-temporal variation (9 factors) for encounter probability and positive
catch rates (\deleted{which we call} 'positive density')
separately\cite{Thorson2015a}. \added{This allows us to} \deleted{By describing
	the species dynamics through underlying contributory spatiotemporal
	factors we can} take account of how the factors contribute to affect
catches of the species in mixed fisheries.\deleted{We use} Gaussian Markov
Random Fields (GMRFs) \deleted{to}capture spatial and temporal dependence
within and among species groups for both encounter probability and positive
density\cite{Thorson2013}.\deleted{VAST is set in a mixed modelling framework
	to allow estimation of} Fixed effects\deleted{to} account for
systematic differences driving encounter and catches\deleted{,} such as
differences in sampling efficiency (a.k.a. catchability), while random effects
capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of the fish community.

\deleted{We use the highly mixed demersal fisheries of the Celtic Sea as a case
	study.} The Celtic Sea is a temperate sea where fisheries are spatially
and temporally complex\deleted{; mixed fisheries are undertaken by several
	nations using different gear types}\cite{Ellis2000, Gerritsen2012}.
Close to 150 species have been identified in the commercial catches of the
Celtic Sea, with approximately 30 species dominating the catch\cite{Mateo2016}.
We parameterise our\deleted{spatiotemporal} model using catch data from seven
fisheries-independent surveys undertaken\deleted{in the Celtic Sea} over the
period 1990 - 2015 (Table S1) and include nine of the main
commercial species (see Table S2) \deleted{: Atlantic cod
	(\textit{Gadus morhua}), Atlantic haddock (\textit{Melanogrammus
		aeglefinus}), Atlantic whiting (\textit{Merlangius merlangus}),
	European Hake (\textit{Merluccius merluccius}), white-bellied
	anglerfish (\textit{Lophius piscatorius}), black-bellied anglerfish
	(\textit{Lophius budegassa}), megrim (\textit{Lepidorhombus
		whiffiagonis}), European Plaice (\textit{Pleuronectes
		platessa}) and Common Sole (\textit{Solea solea}). These
	species} which make up \textgreater 60 \% of landings by towed fishing
gears for the area (average 2011 - 2015\cite{STECF2017}). Each species was
separated into juvenile and adult size classes based on their legal minimum
conservation reference size (Table S2).

\deleted[id = coilin]{We analyse the data to understand how the different
	associations among emergent species-groups (combination of species and
	size class) and their potential drivers affect catch compositions in
	mixed fisheries. We consider how these have changed over time, and the
	implications for mixed fisheries in managing catches of quota species
	under the EU landing obligation.}

A spatial dynamic factor analysis decomposes the dominant spatial patterns
driving differences in encounter probability and positive density. The first
three factors\deleted{(after PCA rotation)} account for 83.7\% of the between
species variance in average encounter probability and 69\% of the between
species variance in average positive density. A clear spatial pattern can been
seen both for encounter probability and positive density, with a positive value
associated with the first factor in the inshore north easterly part of the
Celtic Sea into the Bristol Channel and Western English Channel, moving to a
negative value offshore in the south-westerly waters (Fig. 1).  The species
loadings coefficients show plaice, sole and whiting to be positively associated
with the first factor for encounter probability while the other species are
negatively associated. For average positive density, positive associations are
also found for haddock and juvenile cod. \deleted{This is indicative of a more
	inshore distribution for these species.} 

On the second spatial factor for encounter probability a north / south split
can be seen at approximately 49$^{\circ}$ N while positive density is more
driven by a positive value in the deeper westerly waters as well as some
inshore areas. Species values for the second factor indicate there are positive
associations for juvenile monkfish (\emph{L. piscatorius}), juvenile hake,
juvenile megrim, plaice and juvenile whiting with average positive density,
which may reflect two different spatial distributions in the more offshore and
in the inshore areas (Fig. 1).

On the third factor, there is a positive association with the easterly waters
for encounter probability and negative with the westerly waters. This
\deleted{manifests in the species associations as} splits\deleted{ting} the
roundfish species cod, haddock and whiting which\deleted{all} have a positive
association with the third factor for average encounter probability from the
rest of the species\deleted{which have a negative association}.  Positive
density is driven by a north / south split (Fig. 1), with positive values in
the northerly areas. Juvenile monkfish (\emph{L.  budgessa} and \emph{L.
	piscatorius}), cod, juvenile haddock, hake, adult plaice and whiting
are also positively associated with the third factor in the north while adult
monkfish (\emph{L. budgessa} and \emph{L.  piscatorius}), adult haddock,
megrims, juvenile plaice and sole are negatively associated \deleted{reflecting
	their more southerly distribution} (Fig. 1).

\deleted{While this exploratory factor analysis is modelling unobserved drivers
	of distribution,} \deleted[id = brutus]{We considered what might be
	driving the differences seen in the spatial factor loadings. The first
	factor was highly correlated with log(depth) for both encounter
	probability (-0.85, CI = -0.88 to -0.81; Fig. S1) and
	positive density (-0.71, CI = -0.77 to -0.65; Fig. S2),}
\deleted{A random forest classification tree assigned} \deleted[id =
brutus]{with 80 \% of the variance in the first factor for encounter
	probability to depth and predominant substrate type, with the majority
	(86 \%) of the variance explained by depth (random forest
	classification tree).} \deleted{The variance explained by these
	variables dropped to 25 \% on the second factor with a more even split
	between depth and substrate, while explaining 60 \% of the variance on
	the third factor.  For positive density, the variables explained less
	of the variance with 62 \%, 35 \%, and 31 \% for each of the factors,
	respectively.}

\deleted[id = brutus]{It is clear that depth and to a lesser extent substrate
	are important predictors for the main driver of similarities and
	differences in distributions and abundances for the different species.}
\deleted{The first factor correlates strongly with these variables, despite
	them not explicitly being incorporated in the model. While depth was
	incorporated as a covariate in an alternative model formulation (see
	Methods), it was found not to improve predictions. The utility of these
	variables as predictors of species distributions has been}\deleted[id =
brutus]{, as identified in other marine species distribution
	models\cite{Robinson2011}; the advantage to the approach taken here is
	that, where such data is unavailable at appropriate spatial resolution,
	the spatial factor analysis can adequately characterise these
	influences on species spatial dynamics.}

\deleted{While there are clear spatial patterns in the factor coefficients
	describing differences in average (over time) encounter probability and
	positive density (Fig. 1),}\deleted{The} Inter-annual differences in
factor coefficients show less structure (Figs. S5, S6). These
inter-annual differences are important as they reflect the ability of fishers
to predict where they can target species from one year to the next.\deleted{,
	without which it may be difficult to avoid unwanted
	catch}\deleted{There were, however, While spatio-temporal factor
	coefficients did not show consistent trends from year to year across
	all species,} Common patterns in spatiotemporal factor coefficients
among species\deleted{there were clear relationships (Fig. 2)}\deleted{.  The
	same factors appear to} drive spatiotemporal distributions of megrim,
anglerfish species and hake (the deeper water species, species-group negatively
associated with the second axes of Fig. 2a) and the roundfish and flatfish
(species-group more positively associated with the second axes of Fig. 2a).
For spatio-temporal positive density (Fig. 2b) cod, haddock and whiting (the
roundfish species) are separated from plaice, sole (the flatfish) and deeper
water species.  \deleted{As such,} \deleted[id = brutus]{From this it can be
	predicted that higher catches of a species within a group (e.g.  cod in
	roundfish) would be expected when catching another species within that
	group (e.g.  whiting in roundfish), \deleted{. This} suggesting
	\deleted{that} one or more common environmental drivers are influencing
	the distributions of the species groups, and that driver differentially
	affects the species groups, but this could not be explained by
	temperature} \deleted{is often included as a covariate in species
	distribution models, but was found not to contribute to the variance in
	the first factor values}\deleted[id = brutus]{ (Fig. S6,
	no correlations found for either encounter probability or positive
	density).}

\replaced[id = coilin]{To}{In order to} gain greater insight into the community
dynamics we considered how species covary in space and time through among
species correlations. Pearson correlation coefficients for the modelled average
spatial encounter probability (Fig. 3a) show clear strong associations between
adult and juvenile size classes for all species (\textgreater 0.75 for all
species except hake, 0.56).\deleted{Among species-groups,} Hierarchical
clustering identified the same three common groups\deleted[id = brutus]{as our
	visual inspection of factor loadings above,} with roundfish (cod,
haddock, whiting)\deleted{closely grouped in their association, with
	correlations for adult cod with adult haddock and adult whiting of 0.73
	and 0.5 respectively, while adult haddock with adult whiting was 0.63
	(Fig. 3a).}, flatfish (plaice and sole)\deleted{are also strongly
	correlated with adult plaice and sole having a coefficient of 0.75.
	The final group are principally the} and species found in the deeper
waters (hake, megrim and both anglerfish species)\deleted{with the megrim
	strongly associated with the budegassa anglerfish species (0.88).
	Negative relationships were found between plaice, sole and the monkfish
	species (-0.27, -0.26 for the adult size class with budegassa adults
	respectively) and hake (-0.33, -0.37) (Fig. 3a)} showing strong
intra-group correlations indicating similar spatial distributions.\deleted{This
	confirms the associations among species seen in the factor loadings,
	with three distinct species-group assemblages being
	present.}\deleted{This is also evident in} Correlation coefficients for
the average positive density also have strong associations among\deleted{the}
roundfish (Fig. 3b). \deleted{show fewer significant positive or negative
	relationships among species than for encounter probability, but still
	evident are the strong association among the roundfish with higher
	catches of cod are associated with higher catches of haddock (0.58) and
	whiting (0.47), as well as the two anglerfish species (0.71 for
	piscatorius and 0.44 for budegassa) and hake (0.73). Similarly, plaice
	and sole are closely associated (0.31) and higher catches of one would
	expect to see higher catches of the other, but also higher catches of
	some juvenile size classes of roundfish (whiting and haddock) and
	anglerfish species.  Negative association of juvenile megrim,
	anglerfish (budegassa) and hake with adult sole (-0.61, -0.61 and -0.47
	respectively), plaice (-0.36 and -0.35 for megrim and hake only)
	indicate high catches of one can predict low catches of the other
	successfully.}

\deleted{In addition to the average spatial correlations, we also estimate
	spatiotemporal correlations. Spatial population correlations
	(representing the average correlations between pairs for species
	\textit{x} and species \textit{y} across all years) are linearly
	associated with the spatiotemporal population correlations
	(representing how correlations between species \textit{x} and species
	\textit{y} change from year to year), indicating generally predictable
	relationships between species from one year to the next. This suggests
	that a positive or negative association between two species is likely
	be persist from one year to the next, and that species are consistently
	associated with each other in the catch. The correlation coefficients
	were 0.59 (0.52 - 0.66) and 0.47 (0.38 - 0.55) for encounter
	probability and positive density respectively.  However, a linear
	regression between the spatial correlations and the spatio-temporal
	correlations shows high variance (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.36 and 0.22
	respectively), indicating that the scale of these relationships does
	change from one-year to the next. This would have implications for the
	predictability of the relationship between catches of one species and
	another when trying to balance catch with quotas in mixed fisheries. It
	can also be seen in the spatial factor maps that there are subtle
	differences in spatial patterns in factor loading values from one year
	to the next (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5) indicating changes may be
	driven by temporally changing environmental factors and species
	behaviour.}


\deleted[id = coilin]{The analysis shows the interdependence within the
	species-groups of roundfish, flatfish and deeper water species, where
	catching one species within the group indicates a high probability of
	catching the other species, which has important implications for how
	spatial avoidance can be used to support implementation of the EU's
	landings obligation. }If production from mixed fisheries is to be
maximised, decoupling catches of species between and within the groups will be
key. For example, asking where the maximal separation in the densities of two
coupled species is likely to occur?\deleted{To address this requirement,} We
map the difference in spatial distribution \deleted{within a group}for each
pair of species within a species-group for a single year (2015; Fig. 4)
\deleted{. This would}\added{to} facilitate discussion on maximal separation,
for example, between difficult to separate species such as haddock and whiting
(Fig. 4c). \deleted{Cod had a more north-westerly distribution than haddock,
	while cod was more westerly distributed than whiting roughly delineated
	by the 7$^{\circ}$ W line (Fig. 4a). Whiting appeared particularly
	concentrated in an area between 51 and 52 $^{\circ}$ N and 5 and 7
	$^{\circ}$ W, which can be seen by comparing the whiting distribution
	with both cod (Fig. 4b) and haddock (Fig. 4c). For the deeper water
	species (Figs. 4d and 4e), hake are more densely distributed in two
	areas compared to anglerfishes and
	%\footnote{two species combined as they are managed as one and megrim
	(though megrim has a stable density across the modelled area as
	indicated by the large amount of white space). For anglerfishes and
	megrim (Fig. 4f), anglerfishes have a more easterly distribution than
	megrim.  For the flatfish species plaice and sole (Fig. 4g), plaice
	appear to be more densely distributed along the coastal areas of
	Ireland and Britain, while sole are more densely distributed in the
	Southern part of the English Channel along the coast of France.}

Predicted catch distribution from a ``typical'' otter trawl gear and beam trawl
fishing at three different locations highlights the differences fishing gear
and location makes on catches (Fig. 4h). \deleted{As can be seen, both the gear
	selectivity and area fished play important contributions to the catch
	compositions;}In the inshore area (location `A') plaice and sole are
the two main species\deleted{in} caught reflecting their distribution and
abundance, though the otter trawl gear catches a greater proportion of plaice
to sole than the beam trawl. The area between Britain and Ireland (location
`B') has a greater contribution of whiting, haddock, cod, hake and anglerfishes
in the catch with the otter trawl catching a greater proportion of the
roundfish, haddock, whiting and cod while the beam trawl catches more
anglerfishes and megrims. The offshore area has a higher contribution of
megrim, anglerfishes and hake with the otter trawl catching a greater share of
hake and the beam trawl a greater proportion of megrim. Megrim dominates the
catch for both gears in location `C', reflecting its relative abundance in the
area.  

\deleted{In application to the Celtic Sea} We have
identified spatial separation of three distinct species-groups (roundfish,
flatfish and deeper water species) while showing that only subtle differences
exist in distributions within species-groups. The differences in catch
compositions between gears at the same location (Fig. 4h) show that changing
fishing methods can go some way to affecting catch, yet that differences in
catches between locations are likely to be more important. \deleted[id =
brutus]{For example, beam trawls fishing at the inshore locations (e.g.
	location `A' in Fig. 4) are likely to predominately catch plaice and
	sole, yet switching to the offshore locations (e.g. location `C') would
	likely yield greater catches of megrim and anglerfishes.
	Such}\added{This highlights that} changes in spatial fishing patterns
are likely to play an important role in supporting implementation of the
landings obligation.

More challenging is within-group spatial separation due to
\deleted{significant}overlaps in spatial distributions for the species, driven
by common environmental factors. Subtle changes in location fished may yield
some benefit in changing catch composition, yet the outcome is likely to be
much more difficult to predict.\deleted{For example,} Subtle differences in the
distribution of cod, haddock and whiting can be seen in Figs. 4a-c, showing
spatial separation of catches is \deleted[id = brutus]{much more challenging
	and}likely to need to be supported by other measures such as changes to
the selectivity characteristics of gear\cite{Santos2016}. 

A role that science can play in supporting effectiveness of spatiotemporal
avoidance \replaced[id = Paul]{is}{could be}in providing probabilistic advice
on\deleted{likely} hotspots for species\deleted{occurrence and high species
	density} which can inform fishing decisions. Previous modelling studies
have shown how spatiotemporal models could improve predictions of high ratios
of bycatch species to target species\cite{Ward2015, Cosandey-Godin2015,
	Breivik2016}, and geostatistical models are well suited\deleted{to
	this} as they incorporate spatial dependency while providing for
probabilities to be drawn from posterior distributions of parameter
estimates. We posit\deleted{that} such advice could be enhanced by integrating
data obtained directly from commercial fishing vessels at a higher temporal
resolution, providing real-time forecasts to inform fishing choices that also
captures seasonal differences in distributions\deleted{, akin to weather
	forecasting}. \added{Such} advice\deleted{informed by a model including
	a seasonal or real-time component} could inform optimal policies for
time-area closures, move-on rules or even as informal information\deleted{to
	be} utilised by fishers directly\added{.}\deleted[id =
Paul]{being reliant on costly continuous data collection on environmental
	parameters}\deleted{, but by using the vessels-as-laboratories
	approach}

An important question for the implementation of the EU's landing obligation is
how far spatial avoidance can go to achieve catch balancing in fisheries. Our
model captures differences between location fished for two gear types
and\deleted{their} broad scale effect on catch composition\deleted{,
	information crucial for managers in implementing the landing
	obligation}.\deleted{Results of} Empirical studies\deleted{undertaken
	elsewhere}\cite{Branch2008, Kuriyama2016} suggest limits to the
effectiveness of spatial avoidance, with differences in ability to change catch
composition observed for different fleets\deleted{; in the North Sea targeting
	ability was found to differ between otter and beam trawlers as well as
	between vessels of different sizes}\cite{Pascoe2007}.\deleted{It is
	likely}\deleted{, however, that} \added{This} analysis \added{likely}
reflects a lower bound on\deleted[id = coilin]{the utility of spatial}
avoidance as fine-scale behavioural decisions such as time-of-day, gear
configuration and location choices can also be used to affect
catch\cite{Abbott2015, Thorson2016}.

\deleted{Our framework allows for a quantitative understanding of the broad
	scale global production set available to fishers\cite{Reimer2017} and
	thus the extent to which they can alter catch compositions while
	operating in a mixed fishery.  Simulations of spatial effort allocation
	scenarios based on the production sets derived from the model estimates
	could be used as inputs to fisher behavioural models to allow for
	identification of the lower bounds of optimum spatial harvest
	strategies. This would provide managers with information useful for
	examining trade-offs in quota setting by integrating potential for
	spatial targeting in changing catch composition, thus provide a
	scientific contribution to meeting the goal of maximising catches in
	mixed fisheries within single stock quota constraints\cite{Ulrich2016}.
	Further, the correlations among species could provide information on
	fisheries at risk of capturing protected, endangered or threatened
	species such as elasmobranches, and allow identification of areas where
	there are high ratios of protected to target species.}


Complex environmental, fishery and community drivers of distribution for
\deleted[id = brutus]{groups of}species highlights the scale of the challenge
in separating catches\deleted[id = brutus]{within the species-groups} using
spatial management measures. This has important implications for management of
the mixed fisheries under the EU landings obligation. Our analysis identifies
where it may be easier to separate catches of species (among groups) and where
it is more challenging (within groups). We propose that the framework presented
in Figs. 1-4 provides a viable route to reducing the complexity of highly mixed
systems.  This can allow informed management discussion over more traditional
anecdotal knowledge of single-species distribution in space and time.
