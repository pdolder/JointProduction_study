\section{Objectives} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Goals for study} 
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{2em}
\item Evaluate inter-species dynamics of main commercial fish populations in the
	Celtic Sea 
\item Explore strength of interdependence of fisheries on the different species
	(and the ability to separate catches) of species \textit{x} from species
	\textit{y}
\item Make efficient use of (and combine) the various surveys that have been
	undertaken in IE, FR, UK in past 20-odd years.
\end{enumerate}

}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Expected outcomes}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{2em}
	\item A useful index of abundance for the species/species groups taking
		account of the irregular nature of survey coverage 
	\item A measure of dependence of the species in space and time.
	\item Insight into the spatio-temporal dynamics of the individual
		species as a pre-cursor to exploring fisheries dynamics.
\end{enumerate}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methods} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Modelling framework} 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item Used \textbf{VAST} (Vector-Autoregressive Spatio-temporal) model
		developed by Jim Thorson @ NOAA, NWFSC, Seattle.
	\item Spent approx. 5 weeks in Seattle over the summer, based at SAFS, UW
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Modelling framework}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implements a spatio-temporal delta-generalised linear mixed model
		taking account of correlations among multiple species / size
		classes.
	\item Estimates spatio-temporal variation in density with spatial point
		data.
	\item VAST builds from several developments by Jim and others in using
		model-based geostatistical methods. VAST can be found and
		installed as an R package @
		\url{https://github.com/james-thorson/VAST}
	\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Modelling framework} 

Numerous publications documenting development of elements of the modelling framework:

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item Two-step delta-Generalised GLMM
		\begin{itemize}
			\item logit-link linear predictor for \textit{encounter
				probability}
			\item log-link or gamma linear predictor for \textit{catch rate}
		\end{itemize}
	\item Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) process to model
		spatio-temporal variation in abundance as a random effect
		\begin{itemize}

				encounter probability \& catch rate among locations
			\item Includes a covariance matrices to describe
				encounter probability \& catch rate among
				species(group)
			\item covariance modelled with a matérn correlation

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
		\setcounter{enumi}{2}
	\item Covariance among species is represented by loading factors
		following a factor-analysis decomposition.
	\item Can incorporate fixed or random vessel effects as well as covariates
		for spatial predictions (e.g. habitat, depth).
	\item Input to the model is the point data for catches (in biomass) per
		species, per station and estimate of swept area - seasonal
		variation can also be incorporated in later versions of
		software.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Model implementation} 
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item Model uses INLA R package to find (user defined) spatial knots
		reflecting the spatial distribution of the data
	\item Parameter estimation for fixed effects done via Maximum
		Likelihood Estimation in Template Model Builder (TMB) using the
		Laplace approximation. The TMB code is auto-generated by the R
		package.
	\item Fit using the super-computers at ICHEC (Irish Centre for High End Computing)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item low level parallelisation on 24 cores, access to
				lots of memory
			\item Still takes long runtimes (~ 2 days)

\frame{\frametitle{Available survey data} 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{2em}
	\item Collated available survey data from both ICES Datras (IE-IGFS,
		FR-EVHOE) and Cefas data (WCGFS, Q4SWIBTS, Q1SWBEAM, NWGFS,
		CARLHELMAR).
	\item Selected catch records for gadoids (cod, haddock, whiting, hake),
		flatfish (plaice, sole) and shelf (anglerfishes (2 spp.),
		megrims).
	\item Processed catch data to estimate biomass per swept area per tow
		for 2 size classes per species: juveniles (\textless MCRS) and adults
		(\textgreater MCRS).
\end{itemize}

		\item For beam trawls: fixed width * distance * CF
		\item For otter trawls: Doorspread * distance * CF

		\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Clean up any outliers (EVHOE 2.5m whiting!)

\frame{\frametitle{Future steps}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Complete at run with a higher number of knots / factors to ensure
		fidelity in the model
	\item Test predictive capability: drop 1 year, predict and compare to
		data:  Useful for closed areas?
	\item Can also be applied to commercial data: vessel as random effect -
		Seasonal model? Useful for identifying hotspots ??
